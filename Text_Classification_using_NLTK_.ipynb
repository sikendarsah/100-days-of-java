            "14:4,28:3).\n",
            "The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic.\n",
            "The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies).\n",
            "The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity.\n",
            "After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn.\n",
            "7-12).\n",
            "Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings).\n",
            "Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith.\n",
            "The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion.\n",
            "All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n",
            "The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages.\n",
            "The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups.\n",
            "The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n",
            "The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful.\n",
            "Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\n",
            "Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality.\n",
            "Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists.\n",
            "The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\n",

            "There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the Greek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old Iranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht, several Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\n",
            "We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra, means \"camel.\"\n",
            "The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when Zarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books of Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology.\n",
            "[See Avesta.]\n",
            "Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in Western culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented, and heterogeneous.\n",
            "Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"), attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the Avesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha Spentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha Vashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the prophet's death.\n",
            "Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE.\n",
            "Although the Achaemenid inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is mentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who seems unaware of him).\n",
            "The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of Zarathushtra.\n",
            "But the text is useful in an indirect way, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians.\n",
            "The Greek sources, on the other hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra, although from a historical point of view they are unreliable.\n",
            "Some place him six thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Hermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny).\n",
            "The account by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes against Greece.\n",
            "This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes reference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut Humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it is generally rejected.\n",
            "Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as the above account would seem to demonstrate.\n",
            "They also show that by this time Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an extremely distant past.\n",
            "All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close to, that of the Achaemenids.\n",
            "Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono- logy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors.\n",
            "Accord- ing to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\n",
            "Again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification.\n",
            "The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the latter position.\n",
            "The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the beginning of Iranian domination.\n",
            "For a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat.\n",
            "In this context, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and Vishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium (thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\n",
            "Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus the Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of the first millennium BCE.\n",
            "Nor is there any mention of the history of that period, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance.\n",
            "At the same time, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be justified.\n",
            "Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the most legitimate.\n",
            "As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran.\n",
            "Some have held that he was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra with Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language of the Avesta.\n",
            "This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precisely from which region.\n",
            "There is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view that he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian region, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat.\n",
            "Most likely, however, Zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia (modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand).\n",
            "It would thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\n",
            "Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna 33.6).\n",
            "He was a zaotar (cf.\n",
            "Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry.\n",
            "Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an athravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste.\n",
            "To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used to lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the product of a great and original ethical mind.\n",
            "Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India to Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan, or \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks truth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death.\n",
            "Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision of asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the \"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta.\n",
            "Behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian mysticism.\n",
            "Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition.\n",
            "Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength of his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic monotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the evil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl., Frashgird) of life and existence.\n",
            "[See Frashokereti]    Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing.\n",
            "They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil.\n",
            "Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\n",
            "Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to understand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\"\n",
            "These are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue.\n",
            "[See Amesha Spentas.]\n",
            "Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"), and of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of Zarathushtra's life.\n",
            "A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\n",
            "According to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision.\n",
            "Only after ten years had passed, however, did he succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs.\n",
            "He was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices.\n",
            "This hostility caused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of Kavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two years old.\n",
            "We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"), and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more sons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of his second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good cattle\") family.\n",
            "Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned: Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"), whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53).\n",
            "Again, according to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven.\n",
            "He was assassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi form).\n",
            "The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi- tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian communities.\n",
            "The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth century, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i Bahram-i Pazhdu.\n",
            "Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about Zarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man.\n",
            "Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the Renaissance until the Enlightenment.\n",
            "During the Classical and Hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien wisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker.\n",
            "Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism.\n",
            "Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as a precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the biblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three Magi to the manger in Bethlehem.\n",
            "[See Magi.]\n",
            "This Christian interpretation is derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the Future.\n",
            "[See Saoshyant.]\n",
            "Later, however, religious struggles arose during the Sasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the spread of Christianity with the Roman empire.\n",
            "Zarathushtra's popularity in the Christian world began to decline.\n",
            "The Iranian prophet, who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three great messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture and heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery.\n",
            "But during the Renaiss- ance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara- thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity.\n",
            "He was viewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean Oracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in Voltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\n",
            "After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883- 1892).\n",
            "Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between good and evil.\n",

            "It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.\n",
            "In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.\n",
            "In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.\n",
            "In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.\n",
            "All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.\n",
            "Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.\n",
            "The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\"\n",
            "Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).\n",
            "(\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)\n",

With flames go prayers 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians faith survive land. \"There fear - real fear, too,\" said Silloo Tarapore Lafayette. \"We one generation die.\" Many immigrant groups struggle maintain identity strange land. But Zoroastrians, especially poignant concern. Their religion around perhaps 3,700 years, heritage deep scarcely seems comprehensible state \"historical sites\" sometimes less 100 years old. It religion great Persian Empire kings Cyrus Darius. And tradition says Christ born 500 years later, honored visit three Zoroastrian priests, Magi. Scholars say many key beliefs Christians, Jews Muslims traced teachings Zoroaster, Zoroastrian prophet. Yet, 150,000 Zoroastrians entire world, miniscule minority every country live. Survival people much minds. Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear almost unlimited tolerance United States may hundreds years persecution followed nearly 1,000 years benign religious segregation could do: cause young people stop thinking Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians believe right religion, actually shun notion trying win converts. So children become totally assimilated, say, children - rather world large - losers. \"It's important identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia San Jose, leader among Zoroastrians came India. \"It's important everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans. It gives meaning life. You depend majority community give respect. You fall back identity.\" For Zoroastrians, there's much proud of. Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking make sense culture animal sacrifice multiple gods common, preached one god, good one. Zoroastrians call god Ahura Mazda, translates Lord Wisdom Light. _Good vs. evil_ Zoroaster saw life constant struggle good evil, good eventually winning. Men women could join battle good, said, warned would inevitably suffer consequences shame sorrow wrong. He preached honesty, charity, kindness animals, respect environment, hard work, equality men women - basic virtues preached prophets many religions. But Zoroaster perhaps unusual told followers follow blindly. He demanded think themselves. In fact, Joseph Campbell, famous scholar history meaning myths, traced Western emphasis individual thought Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians many words thought. Their motto, leaded stained glass window sacred fire temple slopes Mount Hamilton, \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\" So surprising Zoroastrians value education highly.

Matthew relates Judas hanged himself, Peter tells us fell crushed impact. The two statements indeed different, necessarily contradict other? Matthew say Judas fall; neither Peter say Judas hang himself. This matter one person calling something black person calling white. Both accounts true supplementary.

The fall could *or* death either would fit explanation. This possibility entirely natural terrain valley Hinnom examined.

This significant, evidence silly Bullinger's exegisis was, stated word \"field\" Matthew (ie: agros) different word \"field\" Acts (ie: chorion), thus must talking two different fields (Of course already admit stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, small serendipity drives point home).

Although possible plausible fell hanging > hit rocks, thereby bursting open, I longer assume > case. Therefore, contradiction.

It is, > however, highly probable. ^^^^^^ > Also, nothing Greek suggest success failure. It simply > means \"hang oneself\". Actually, research Greek word \"apacgw,\" find denote success. Those scholars indeed excellent reason assume suicide successful. As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons: \"Greek English Lexicon New Testament,\" Louw Nida \"Robinson's Greek English Lexicon New Testament\" \"Greek English Lexicon New Testament,\" Grimm \"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale \"A Greek English Lexicon New Testament early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher A couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", couple explicit stated \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill hanging.\" A couple also noted meaning one root words \"apacgw\" \"strangle, throttle choke\" (which pretty much invalidates guy suggested David Joslin Judas hung upside down). One best references though, \"Robinson's Greek English Lexicon New Testament,\" stated translation, gave root words, literal translation, related greek words use roots, also presented specific examples word greek literature (to give context). The word \"apagchw\" two root words: \"gchw\" \"to strangle\" root, root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words included words denote transition. It mean transition place (eg: greek word \"apagello\" means send message). \"Apo\" also denote change state specifically change life death. Robinson specifically makes comparison word \"apokteiuo,\" means \"to kill.\" In literal meaning word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle put way,\" implicitly denotes change life state (ie: away life, death). So word \"apacgw\" mean \"to hang,\" specifically denotes death well. Thus Robinson quite specific state means \"to hang oneself, end one's life hanging.\" He notes use \"apacgw\" Homers Odessy 19:230 denote context. He presents example \"apacgw\" used explicitly mean \"suicide hanging.\" Now since perfectly good word strangling, without added denotation \"death,\" insist Bible written God, every word precicely correct, stuck complete meaning \"apacgw\" (ie: Since word \"apacgw\" used, death denoted result). By way, I note Mr DeCenso also presents example \"apacgw\": > In Septuagint (the Greek translation OT used time Jesus), > used 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now Ahithophel saw advice > followed, saddled donkey, arose went home house, > city. Then put household order, hanged himself, > died; buried father's tomb.\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > ^^^^ > Notice stated Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept., > APAGCHO], explicitly adds, \"and died\". Here doubt > result. > In Matthew, explicitly told Judas died. Note Mr DeCenso, say, Septuagint translation Hebrew Greek, shown original meaning Hebrew (ie\" Hebrew say \"and died\"), thus whether simply echoed Greek. It also pointed that, regardless added \"and died\", correct translation would still \"apacgw,\" man indeed die strangulation (redundant, correct). Further, evidence Septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited (which included versions contradicted other), editing even necessarily executed Greeks. Thus I sure use Septuagint stands, paragon ancient greek. So, really need prove point Mr DeCenso, example, ancient greek, someone committing \"apacgw\" surviving. Otherwise I would see simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence. Now I would note Mr DeCenso, everytime I go way research one apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find false. Thus, I think going add text, something source clearly says, better explicit Greek historical source justify it. By way, Mr Rose's statement trees around Potter's Field: > There still trees around ledges rocky pavement bottom. Unless Mr Rose show trees two thousand years old, 2000 year old stumps there, 2 thousand year old description area mentions trees, inappropriate assert present placement trees prove location trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change). Now argument, ie: money Judas used 30 silvers: > As second question Mr DeCenso, ask could sure > money Judas purchased land, indeed betrayal, rather > source. I would point Acts, specifically > mention \"the reward iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], also specifically mentions > act iniquity talking (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning > Judas guide arrested Jesus.\"). Now I would point > Bible describes act \"iniquity,\" immediately > discusses \"*the* reward iniquity,\" would rather inane suggest > action iniquity one discussed.\" > > > Notice verse 16, word \"iniquity\" used. Rather, states > Judas \"became guide arrested Jesus\". > But writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for numbered us > obtained part ministry.\" What part Judas play ministry? > ^^^^^^ True, Peter (or author Acts) specifically call Judas' betrayal \"an iniquity,\" matter, neither John specifically call Judas' actions \"an iniquity\" either. Further John 13:29 say Judas took money box, rather said: \"Some thought because, Judas money box, Jesus telling \"Buy need feast\"; give something poor, So receiving morsel immediately went out, night.\" Note said Judas left, say took money box. Thus I see explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity, mentioned another author, different book, written different time, iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts. I find forced contrived. Of course particular argument becomes moot, since seen evidence \"apacgw\" means suicide. You see, since Judas' hanging successful, could spent money mentioned John 13:29, Matthew Mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day (ie: Passover), thus could spent money killing next day. Thus money bought \"Field Blood\" would 30 pieces silver (Of course got 30 pieces silver night well, thus spent either. Oh dear, I believe house cards comming down). Maybe point, discuss whether Jesus crucified Friday Saturday part argument Judas. By way, prophesy Potter's field came (ie: mention Matthew), say: > Please, done study death, remind discuss > you. I reminding discuss now. It's part verse discussing, I wish would quit procrastinating sidestepping issues. Later, Dave Butler A wise man proportions belief evidence. David Hume, Philosopher An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding PS. I would note again, stating Bible possibly inerrant; stating *IS* inerrant. Since been, admission, presenting merely \"possible\" reconciliations (I course rate highly), best say Bible \"possibly\" inerrant, *is* inerrant.

I forgot posted alt.conspiracy. I smell paranoia here. Since Nazis never officially charged Roehm homosexuality (at least, according I've read), I'd like know tainted \"evidence\" talking about. Since accusations made persons outside Nazi party, long came power, accusations common knowledge journalists others Germany 1920's 30's, would possible Nazis go back time plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly one doctor newspapers circulated around world, without discrepancies obvious? What actual incidences Nazi doctoring evidence matter know about? And testimony people involved matters, Nazis? And point making false accusation homosexuality publicize it? Since point seems discredit established history, burden proof falls revisionist. The revisionists better homework making accusations. Otherwise simply look like conspiracy nuts. >The available data suggest Roehm crowd, >the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left world better >place departed, This *only* thing agree on.

Matthew 5:17 \"Think I come abolish law prophets; I come abolish fulfil them. Matthew 5:18 For truly, I say you, till heaven earth pass away, iota, dot, pass law accomplished. Matthew 5:19 Whoever relaxes one least commandments teaches men so, shall called least kingdom heaven; teaches shall called great kingdom heaven. Matthew 5:20 For I tell you, unless righteousness exceeds scribes Pharisees, never enter kingdom heaven. There several problems this. The serious Law regarded Jews time (and now) binding Jews, Gentiles. There rules binding human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), quite minimal. The issue Church face Jesus' death Gentiles wanted follow Christ. The decision impose Law say Law abolished. It simply acknowledged fact apply Gentiles. This simple answer, I think everyone agree to. (A discussion issue less terms recorded Acts 15.) However there's involved. In order get full picture role Law, come grips Paul's apparent rejection Law, relates Jesus' commendation Law. At least I read Paul, says Law serves purpose certain sense superceded. Again, issue one abolition Law. In middle discussion, Paul notes might understood way, assures us that's intends say. Rather, sees Law primarily present convict people sinfulness. But ultimately impossible standard, one superceded Christ. Paul's comments world's clearest here, everyone agrees reading. But interesting thing notice even radical position entail abolition Law. It still remains uncompromising standard, iota dot may removed. For purpose convicting sin, important relaxed. However Christians, end -- ultimately live faith, Law. While theoretical categories use rather different, end I think Jesus Paul come rather similar conclusion. The quoted passage Mat 5 taken context rest Sermon Mount, Jesus shows us interprets Law. The \"not iota dot\" would suggest rather literal reading, fact that's Jesus' approach. Jesus' interpretations emphasize intent Law, stay away ceremonial details. Indeed well known taking rather free attitude towards Sabbath kosher laws. Some scholars claim Mat 5:17-20 needs taken context 1st Cent. Jewish discussions. Jesus accuses opponents caring giving tenth even minor herbs, neglecting things really matter: justice, mercy faith, caring cups plates cleaned, fact inside people use full extortion rapacity. (Mat 23:23-25) This, discussion later Mat 5, suggest Jesus specific view Law mind, talks maintaining Law full strength, thinking aspects it. Paul's conclusion similar. While talks Law superceded, specific examples gives involve \"ceremonial law\", circumcision Sabbath. He quite concerned maintaining moral standards. The net result Paul talks Law superceded, Jesus talks Law maintained, I believe talking different aspects Law. Paul embroiled arguments circumcision. As natural letters responding specific situations, he's looking aspect Law currently causing trouble: Law specifically Jewish ceremonies. He certainly intend abolish divine standards conduct. On hand, Jesus commends Law, seems talking Law broadest implications morals human relationships, deemphasizing aspects later give Paul much trouble. It's unfortunate people use terms different ways, familiar current conflicts. Look way terms like \"family values\" take special meaning current context. Imagine poor historian future trying figure \"family values\" used code word opposition homosexuality one specific period U.S. I think Law taken similar role arguments Paul involved in. Paul clearly rejecting Jewish values go along term \"Law\", people concerned \"family values\" movement really opposed family values.

Gay people con- tinue persecuted long propaganda petpetuates. You may unaware statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans published used various groups re-enforce bias African-Americans. We usually think KKK instances, many groups. Of course, vast majority public scoff findings documents today, always case. Fortunately African-Americans \"whites\" supported 'cause' public sentiment eventually (if entirely) turned around. There even Civil War, anti-negro sentiment increased. In fact, laws put place protect inalienable rights Blacks pretty much legal discriminate them. I know many gays I NOT turn back right free form discrimination. You may think I deceived something, perogative. My church, Christian Church (Disciples Christ) openly affirms rights oppressed people segments society, including gays. We believe Gospel message preaching creation making disciples. We believe Lord's great commandment Love, beleive standing oppressed, even popular so. I really like church last reason most. I find church almost anywhere valley stands Gospel believes commandment Love (though I'm hard-pressed find many actually sho Love), many willing champion oppressed, especially within community. I may lost face greater Christian community unpopularity beliefs, abolitionists oppression African-Americans. Many even killed treated runaway slaves \"nigger-lovers\" such. I guess I've decided challenge worth it. In talks gay men women I heard tragic story tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives husbands straight hurt process, etc. Funny thing is, I know one case parents, ex-wives, even children continued reject gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) began take part form support group, like PFLAG. I'm apalled legislation passed Colorado, equally out0 raged slimey people Louis Sheldon (from Tradition Values Coalition) actively working Christian underground garner support within several (8 I believe) states coming November oppressive legisation gays. Perhaps get it, maybe never will. Many get Middle Ages proclaimed God's done massacred thousands witch hunts inquisitions. The message comes through, loud clear, proponents gay rights gays general, strong dislike, even hatred gays, whether want call (it change results). The major flaw posturing end, final effect posts like Mr. Hudson YOU \"conditional\" love gays. Condition: Change we'll love you. This sure strange coming group claim God \"unconditional\" love, one calls people \"just are.\" Sure things 'naturally' change, habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) need changed sort therapy. But things like left-handedness, etc. amount beating people, going result anything outward conforminty \"other people's expectations.\" In process coerced conformity causes many people great deal harm, especially caused people nothing gain become even puffed sense pseuper-spirituality. This sad, I thoroughly believe one day change. It may unpopular cry justice equality basis something personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), I firmly believe rights individuals free impose regulation thier bedrooms. It's funny straight people successfully removed restrictive oppressive legislation invasive legislation, like maintain little chestnut repression...as though helps us maintain sense superiority least one segment society. Gay people criminals. Another interesting thing happened recently. A prominent charismatic church Silicon Valley (here) two pastors arrested self- admitted charges pederasty (men sex boys). This apparently going time (a couple years?), since charges voluntary, church worked closely police, I imagine managed downplay media. How could thing happen church, itself, ex-gay ministry? One friends recently told \"approached\" someone going reparitive therapy there, thoroughly convinced request dinner invitation attend ministry.

Actually, jon, quite true. Christian people caused \"objective morality\" look \"relative.\" After all, point original question thread, i.e. toss Christianity obviously inconsistent principles? If bear me, I attempt explain apparent inconsistency least one Christian's viewpoint: If God exists creator mankind Bible claims, He pretty well-defined concept makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc. GOD \"objective\" morality us. That say, He trouble understanding good (or detrimental to) creature He created. Galatians 2:10-- For [mankind] His workmanship, created Christ Jesus good works [a morality], God prepared beforehand [a well-defined design], might walk them. However, contrary many people assume (including Pharasees Bible,) God's morality cannot completely codified list rules regulations. To extent, every activity person's life creates new situation morality must applied. There never could enough volumes codify God's \"objective\" morality us. Throughout history, mankind tried reduce morality list rules (objectivity, please.) In Old Testament, principles specific rules. By time Jesus, principles obscured emphasis men placed rules. Volumes additional rules made try codify application principles. We [mankind] comfortable \"subjectivity\" principles. For reference see Matthew 5 Jesus explains difference Law principles Law. For example, verses 21-22: \"You heard ancients told, 'You shall commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall liable court.' But I say everyone angry brother shall liable court...\" The \"objective morality\" God gets blurred inept interpretation it. We [Christians] made biggest errors allowed one person group people decide EXACTLY God intended us. If [Christians] would stay committed seeking God's instead trying prove already figured out, might better job allowing others find God's \"objective morality\" themselves.

No. There two problems here: (1) Peter died two millenia ago. The original letters wrote long since decayed dust. If alive today I could question him, might lend credibility claims (but probably much, all, I've heard people claim sincerity they've spoken Elvis recently). But death, Peter's writings transcribed monks centuries, I find hard believe one somewhere decide change wording something make (in opinion) little easier understand. (2) Even Peter witness miracles Jesus two millenia ago, mean deity Bible says (God might Satan, trying convince everyone he's nice guy), even deity still alive active world today. Nice try, enough convince me, especially since wild claims deity seem fly face way I've observed world work.

But important related facts Christians COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, followers world religions. First, Jesus Christ NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH- STANDING. There ALWAYS least one Divine Master (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE world AT ALL TIMES, continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, life Jesus. The followers Masters founded world's major religions, usually PERVERTING teachings Master process. Christians, example, added THREATS \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" Hell, DELETED teaching REincarnation. Secondly, importantly, particular Master physically dies leaves world, NOTHING He ANYbody except relatively people He INITIATED He still PHYSICALLY alive. (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE UNIVERSES.) Therefore, Christians worship Jesus, pray Jesus, expect Jesus return save sins, KIDDING THEMSELVES, allowed DUPED religion mostly MANUFACTURED Romans. And emotional \"feelings\" TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator religious validity. These things similarly true followers major world religions, including Islam. Thirdly, primary function Master tune His Initiates \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" \"SOUND CURRENT\", (referred \"THE WORD\" John 1:1-5, \"The River Life\" Revelation 22:1), personally guide thru upper levels Heaven still connected living physical bodies \"silver cord\". True Salvation, completes Soul's cycles REincarnation physical psychic planes, achieved reaching least \"SOUL PLANE\", five levels universes physical universe, canNOT done without help PHYSICALLY-Living Divine Master. One Divine Master alive today American, Sri Harold Klemp, Living \"Eck\" Master \"Mahanta\" \"Eckankar\" organization, headquartered Minneapolis, (P.O. Box 27300; zip 55427). Another Divine Master Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, living Punjab, India, associated \"Sant Mat\" organization. One classic books subject \"THE PATH OF THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA 90247), written 1939 Dr. Julian Johnson, theologian surgeon spent last years life India studying closely observing Sant Mat Master time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. Several Eckankar books, including authored Sri Paul Twitchell Sri Harold Klemp, found public university libraries book stores, obtained thru inter-library loan. The book \"ECKANKAR--THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", Sri Paul Twitchell, ANOTHER classic. Many Christians likely confuse Masters \"Anti-Christ\", temporary world dictator so-called \"last days\". But Masters ever rule, even asked expected Jesus was. People continue following Christianity, Islam, orthodox religions physically-DEAD Master, CONTINUE cycles REincarnation, Psychic Planes MISERABLE physical world, finally accept Initiation PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master. RE-INCARNATION The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", Ruth Montgomery, describes several kinds evidence supporting REincarnation FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS past lives [about 50% accurate; subconscious mind sometimes makes things up, especially bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially young children, identify recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL past life experi- ences, DEJA VU (familiarity far land travel- ing first time vacation), psychic read- ings late EDGAR CAYCE, EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John Baptist REINCARNATION Elias.) John 9:1-2 (How person POSSIBLY sin born, unless LIVED BEFORE?!). [ ALWAYS use \"KING JAMES VERSION\". Later versions PER-VERSIONS! ] Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., typically originate person's PAST LIVES. For example, strong fear swimming traveling water usually results DROWNED end PREVIOUS LIFE. And sometimes person take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE another person met first time THIS life, bad encounter PREVIOUS INCARNATION. The teaching REincarnation also includes LAW OF KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.). People would behave much better toward knew actions present surely reaped future, FUTURE INCARNATION! \"2nd COMINGS\" If Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") particular Initiate His does, Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), Master meet Astral level take directly Soul Plane. This ONE AND ONLY correct meaning 2nd Coming. It INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something happens everyone once. People still waiting Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" WAITING IN VAIN. PLANES OF EXISTENCE The physical universe LOWEST least DOZEN major levels existence. Above Physical Plane Astral Plane, Causal Plane, Mental Plane, Etheric Plane (often counted upper part Mental Plane), Soul Plane, several higher Spiritual Planes. The Soul Plane FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward Physical). The planes (but NOT including) Physical Soul Planes called Psychic Planes. It likely ESP, telepathy, astrological influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See 1972 book title.], phenomena without apparent physical origin, result INTERACTIONS Psychic Planes Physical Plane. The major planes also SUB-DIVIDED. For example, sub-plane Astral Plane called \"Hades\", Christian Hell occupies SMALL part it, created LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH kind black magic simply teaching existence THREATENING manner. The Christian \"Heaven\" located elsewhere Astral Plane. Good Christians go short REincarnate back Earth. SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH The Christian religion demands followers extraordinary amount BLIND FAITH backed little GOOD FEELING (which TOTALLY DECEIVING). If person HEARING form \"SOUND CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), cycles REINCARNATION MISERABLE world WILL CONTINUE. The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently different Initiates, sound like rushing wind, ocean waves sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, flute, various heavenly music, sounds.

The Zoroastrian doctrine Savior Future (Saoshyant) basis story coming Magi Bethlehem _Gospel Matthew_ (2:1-12).] The Old Persian word magu, rendered Greek magos, uncertain etymology. It may originally meant \"member tribe,\" Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile member tribe\"). This meaning would resticted, among Medes, \"member priestly tribe\" perhaps \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term probably Median origin, given Herodotus mentions \"Magoi\" one six tribes Medes. For variety reasons consider Magi members priestly tribe Median origin western Iran. Among Persians, responsible liturgical functions, well maintaining knowledge holy occult. Most likely, supremacy Median priesthood western Iran became established time Median monarchy dominated Persians end eighth century first half sixth century BCE revolt Cyrus Great (550 BCE). The Persians indebted Medes political civil institutions well. Even hypotheses advanced concerning existence Magi Persian origin Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), must still maintain Median origin. This demonstrated eposide revolt Gaumata Magian, mentioned Darius I (522-486 BCE) inscription Bisutun (Iran), well Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists idea usurpatory power Medes Persians conspiracy Magi. The fact Magi may members tribe handed sacerdotal arts hereditary fashion naturally exclude possibility undertook secular prefessions. This seems attested Elamite tablets Persepolis. There theses, put forth Giuseppe Messina, denies Magi members ethnic group suggesting simply members priesthood - priesthood purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis untenable; hand, hypothesis name related Avestan term magavan, derived Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning maga probably found, conformity Pahlavi tradition, within context concept purity, separation \"mixture\" two opposed principles spirit matter. The maga, erroneously interpreted \"chorus,\" root mangh, said mean \"sing magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) rendered simply expression like unio mystica, seems ecstatic condition opens mind spiritual vision. In case, though may relation Old Persian term magu Avestan terms magavan maga, must maintain clear distinction Magi Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores Median Old Persian term, despite recent hypothesis proposed H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore Avestan term \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even perhaps present Achaeminid setting Elamite tablets Persepolis (Gershevitch, 1964). The term magu present Zoroastrianism throughout history; Pahlavi terms mogh-mard mobad represent continuation. The latter particular derives older form, magupati (\"head Magi\"). During Sasanid period (third seventh centuries CE), saw formation hierarchically organized church, title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest high priests\") came used designate summit ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed characteristic funeral rite: exposure corpse animals vultures remove flesh thereby cleanse it. The corpse supposed decompose, lest contaminated demons putrefaction. This practice later became typical entire Zoroastrian community led rise complex funeral ritual Iran among Parsis India. Stone towers, known dakhmas, built especially rite. During time Herodotus practice exposure corpse vogue among Magi; Persians generally sprinkled corpse wax, buried it. The practice widespread, however, among peoples Central Asia. The Magi technicians experts worship: impossible offer sacrifices without presence Magus. During performance ritual sacrifice, Magus sang theogony (the Magi possibly custodians tradition sacred poetry, know nothing relationship tradition various parts Avesta) called upon interpret dreams divine future. The Magi also known practice killing harmful, \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra) snakes ants. They dressed Median style, wearing pants, tunics, coats sleeves. They wore characteristic head covering felt (Gr. tiara) strips sides could used cover nose mouth rituals avoid contaminating consecrated objects breath (Boyce, 1982). The color caps, conformity tradition probably Indo-European origin, according Georges Dumezil, priesthood: white. In likelihood, Achaemenid period Magi possession well-defined body doctrine, probable gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; likely clergy consisting professional priests tied rigid orthodoxy naturally inclined eclecticism syncretism. Nonetheless, must jealous guardians patrimony Zorastrian traditions. By virtue educators royal princes. The wisest responsible teaching prince \"magic Zarathushtra, son Horomazes\" thus \"cult gods.\" Magi excelled virtues entrusted education prince would learn just, courageous, master himself. During Achaemenid period Magi maintained position great influence, although certainly subordinate emperor. Despite several dramatic events massacre suffered death Gaumata Magian - which, according Herodotus (who calls Smerdis), Persians killed large number Magi avenge usurpation - Magi nevertheless managed maintain influence court Media, Persia, various regions empire stationed consequence Persian civilian military administration.

But also known Chaldeans, priesthood Babylon, known occultism; perhaps reason term magos pejorative sense Greek, like \"goes,\" \"expert magic arts\" (Bidez Cumont, 1938). Indeed, Chaldeans experts types magical arts, especially astrology, reputation wisdom well knowledge. To understand reasons various sometimes discordant views, necessary distinguish Magi Iran proper so-called western Magi, later hellenized. In Achaemenid period must least part Zoroastrian, western Magi (those Iranian diaspora Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia), came contact diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner later varying degrees, influenced syncretic concepts.

Nonetheless, hypothesis hardly plausible, since first chapter Vendidad - list sixteen lands created Ahura Mazda, supreme god Zoroastrianism, contaminated attack Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), supreme god ultimate source evil suffering - mention western Iran, Persia, Media (the land Ragha mentioned text cannot Median Raghiana). Furthermore, noted (Gershevitch, 1964) authors Magi absence reference western Iranian institutions, including priesthood, would strange. The Magi means Zoroastrian tradition corpus Avesta transmitted us, second half first millennium BCE on. This principal merit. We attribute directly Magi new formulation Iranian dualism assumed, known us especially Greek sources and, part, Pahlavi literature ninth tenth centuries CE. According formulation, two poles dualism longer, Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent spirit\") Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") Ahura Mazda Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation immense consequence historical development Zoro- astrianism likely determined contact Magi Mesopotamian religious world. In new dualism - later known Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus Rhodes, Theopompus, others) - see affirmation new current thought within Zoroastrianism, give name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.] Thanks adherence Zoroastrianism, Magi played enormously important role transmission Zarathushtra's treachings, well definition new forms would assume historically. Their natural propensity eclecticism syncretism also helped diffusion Zoroastrian ideas communities Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began study doctrines take interest (Xanthus Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises Persian religion, titles fragments survived. In Hellenistic period, Magi seen secular school wisdom, writings magic, astrology, alchemy lent authority prestigious names Zarathushtra, Ostanes, Hystaspes, forming abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez Cumont, 1938). Later still, eschatology apocalyptics fertile meeting ground Iranian Judeo-Christian religions, seen famous _Oracles Hystaspes_, work whose Iranian roots undeniable likely dates beginning Christian era, probably second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine Savior Future (Saoshyant) basis story coming Magi Bethlehem _Gospel Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.] The Sasanid period saw Magi play determining role religious history Iran. Concerned win back western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), eager consolidate Zoroastrianism national religion Iran, priests Iranian sanctuaries Media Persia able establish true state church, strongly hierarchical endowed orthodoxy based formation canon scriptures. The leading figures development state religion Zoroastrian orthodoxy Tosar Kerder, persecutors Mani third century. SAOSHYANT: The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates savior world, arrive future time redeem humankind. The concept future savior one fundamental notions Zoro- astrianism, together dualism; appears early Gathas. Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), prophet religion, Sao- shyant, one performs works Frashokereti, end present state world, existence \"rehabilitated\" \"made splendid.\" [See Frashokereti] Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed notion true eschatological myth expanded number Saoshyants one three. All saviors born seed Zarathushtra, preserved ages Lake Kansaoya (identified present-day Lake Helmand, Seistan, Iran), protected 99,999 fravashis, guardian spirits. The greatest awaited Saoshyants, victorious Astvatereta (\"he embodies truth\"), son Vispataurvairi (\"she conquers all\"), third, make existence splendid; appears Yashts 19. Upon arrival humankind longer subject old age, death, corruption, granted unlimited power. At time dead resurrected, living immortal indestructable. Brandishing weapon kills powerful enemies world truth (that is, world spirit, asha), Astvatereta look upon whole corporeal existence render imperishable. He comrades engage great battle forces evil, destroyed. The name Astvatereta clearly result theological speculation (Kellens, 1974), two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he makes truth grow,\" Ukhshyatnemah, \"he makes reverence grow\"; names three virgins (Yashts 13) impregnated seed Zarathushtra bathe Lake Kansaoya give birth Saoshyants, equally speculative. Each Saoshyants arrive beginning millennium, initiating new age new cycle existence; Astvatereta appear third final millennium save mankind. The doctrine future savior already taken shape Archaemenid period (sixth fourth century BCE). It not, perhaps principal element formation messianic idea, certainly determining factor, one enjoyed great success Hellenistic period beyond confines Iranian world. A similar concept, future Buddha, Maitreya, likely indebted it, Christian messianism trace roots source.

This discussion \"objective\" seems falling solipsism (Eg: recent challenge Frank Dwyer, someone prove actually observe phenomena). Someones even made statement science \"subjective\" even atom \"subjective.\" This getting bit silly word \"objective\" losing meaning. Lets start remembering definition \"objective\" already presented: objective ADJ. 1. Of material object distinguished mental concept. 2. Having actual existence. 3.a. Unenfluenced emotion personal prejudice. b. Based observable phenomenon. The Objectivity thing based whether everyone agrees thing (eg: world objectively round, regardless fact exist flat earthers), rather whether based observable verifiable phenomenon (instead based solely peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). Thus atoms, based observable repeatable phenomenon, indeed considered objective rather subjective. Even weird, high energy physics based observable phenomenon (even though observation change outcome). Nor observable phenomenon affected emotion, personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions change whims different people). Thus say science objective (ie: objectively verifiable) bit silly, point science. Now I agree science objectively \"good;\" I thereby conclude though science objective. Now examples things \"objective\": A D-12 tractor larger average breadbox. Chlorophyll green. Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone atmosphere (at least presently). Ozone blocks ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light increases incidents skin Cancer. \"Good\" hand value judgement. It seem existence apart give (unless someone objectively show existence omnipotent entity defined \"good\"). We cannot quantify it, touch collect concrete sense (eg: I bag full \"good\"). Now sometimes attempt give word \"good\" objective meaning, e.g. \"good\" used denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc. That though, subjective definition, might see \"strength\" etc, necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired Naziism generally viewed \"good\"). As morality, I cannot say I ever seen morality strictly based verifiable observable phenomenon. The closest I seen form \"Golden Rule,\" concludes best deliberately piss people off, likely involve life, manner like. This verifiable; \"get someone's face,\" often retaliate. Another objective fact morality powerful group enforce morality weaker group, thus times, ignore form \"Golden Rule\" without fear reprisal. Now whether enforcing morality \"good\" \"bad,\" quite subjective. By way, remember subjective mean thing cannot formally stated, even commonly agreed upon; means verifiable observable phenomena, physical existence unto itself. Also note I stated thing objective morality, I could accept morality; I simply stated I seen evidence morality. One thing notice, \"objective\" many times used synonymous \"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" \"subjective\" sometimes connotation \"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so. For instance, conclusion based objective, insufficient evidence, objective false. As \"absolute,\" easy note objectively show TNT explosive, absolutely mean TNT explode, thus objective necessarily absolute either. On hand, something subjective also either \"absolutist,\" \"true.\" For instance, theists specifically \"absolutist\" morality, even though subjective evidence back up. Further, many scientist detective motivated subjective reasons (eg: \"gut feeling\" \"hunch\"), investigate phenomena situation, gather objective evidence necessary support true hypothesis. On whole though, I would agree objective evidence much trustworthy subjective evidence.

Every text historical fact. Every text written person (or group people) purpose. Hence, every text serve historical evidence. The question is: learn text?

_3,700-year tradit still glow - 'assimil in u.s. threaten ancient zoroastrian religion'_ by jeann huber, mercuri news staff writer high on a hillsid abov san jose, flame leap up 24 hour a day from a gleam brass urn in a templ - one of onli four in the unit state - dedic to one of the world' most ancient religions. with the flame go the prayer of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrian that their faith will surviv thi land. \"there is a fear - a real fear, too,\" said silloo tarapor of lafayette. \"we have one gener to do it or to die.\" mani immigr group struggl to maintain an ident in a strang land. but for zoroastrians, it is an especi poignant concern. their religion ha been around for perhap 3,700 years, a heritag so deep it scarc seem comprehens in a state where \"histor sites\" are sometim less than 100 year old. it wa the religion of the great persian empir under king cyru and darius. and tradit say that when christ wa born about 500 year later, he wa honor by a visit from three zoroastrian priests, the magi. scholar say mani key belief of christians, jew and muslim can be trace to the teach of zoroaster, the zoroastrian prophet. yet, with onli about 150,000 zoroastrian in the entir world, they are a miniscul minor in everi countri in which they live. surviv as a peopl is veri much on their minds. ironically, local zoroastrian fear that the almost unlimit toler of the unit state may do what hundr of year of persecut follow by nearli 1,000 year of benign religi segreg could not do: caus their young peopl to stop think of themselv as zoroastrians. zoroastrian do not believ their is the onli right religion, and they actual shun the notion of tri to win converts. so if their children becom total assimilated, they say, it' their children - rather than the world at larg - who will be the losers. \"it' import to have an identity,\" said maneck bhujwaia of san jose, a leader among zoroastrian who came here from india. \"it' import for everybodi - irish, scottish, americans. it give mean to life. you don't have to depend on the major commun to give you respect. you can fall back on your own identity.\" for zoroastrians, there' much to be proud of. their prophet, zoroaster, seek to make sens of a cultur in which anim sacrific to multipl god wa common, preach that there wa onli one god, a good one. zoroastrian call their god ahura mazda, which translat as lord of wisdom and light. _good vs. evil_ zoroast saw life as a constant struggl between good and evil, with the good eventu winning. men and women could join in the battl for good, he said, and he warn that they would inevit suffer consequ such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong. he preach honesty, charity, kind to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equal of men and women - basic virtu preach by prophet of mani religions. but zoroast wa perhap unusu in that he told hi follow not to follow him blindly. he demand they think for themselves. in fact, joseph campbell, the famou scholar of the histori and mean of myths, trace the western emphasi on individu thought to the zoroastrians. zoroastrian have mani word for thought. their motto, lead into a stain glass window over the sacr fire at the templ on the slope of mount hamilton, is \"good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\" so it' not surpris that zoroastrian valu educ highly. in india, where a conting of zoroastrian arriv in the ninth centuri to escap persecut by muslim in iran, zoroastrian claim 100 percent literacy; the overal statist in india is just 60 percent. about half of the bay area zoroastrian commun came here from india and pakistan, mostli to studi at universities. the other half fled from iran after the 1979 revolut made that a fundamentalist islam state where other had no rights. local zoroastrian point with pride to way their emphasi on \"good deeds\" ha improv life in everi countri they inhabit. in san jose, the recent restor of the hotel saint clari came about becaus manou mobedshahi, a san francisco-bas hotelier, pass the boarded-up downtown landmark on hi way to and from the temple. at the temple' dedication, the chief guest of honor wa the mother of zubin mehta, the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmon orchestra. the templ exist becaus of anoth good deed: the decis by an iranian emigre, the late arbab rustom guiv, to buy land for six templ in north america. besid the 10-acr site off crother road on mount hamilton, he paid for land in lo angeles, chicago, new york, toronto, and vancouver. until hi gifts, there were no zoroastrian templ on thi continent. local zoroastrian rais money to build the actual temple, and the properti alreadi had a larg hous that they have convert to a commun center. the temple, dedic a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster, is a simpl structur with gleam white walls, vault ceil and oak floors, partial cover with huge orient carpets. it central featur is the fire, set in the middl of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building. although zoroastrian are sometim call \"fire worshippers,\" they actual consid fire just a symbol of god. \"it help us concentrate, just like christian use the cross and muslim use the holi book,\" bhujwala said. the biggest celebr of the year occur in earli spring. for all iranians, includ zoroastrians, the new year begin on the first day of the season becaus of it symbol as the start of new life. with zoroaster' birthday just six day later, the combin of religi and secular holiday creat someth on par with what most of the unit state celebr between christma and jan. 1. for thi year' celebr of the prophet' birthday, about 500 peopl came to worship and revel. \"the good thing in life are not forbidden,\" esfandiar anoushiravani, a leader of the iranian members, had said beforehand, and what follow prove him right. insid the temple, worship fill everi chair and sat or stood around the edg of the room as about a half-dozen priest chant thanksgiv prayer around a tabl laden with brazier of smoke sandalwood, glass of milk and water, and a tray heap with dri fruit and nuts. kid crowd around, grab hand of the treats. \"peopl eat the fruit,\" tarapor said. \"it' a way to particip in the ceremony.\" _santa claus, sort of_ the gather even had a santa claus, iranian style. with flow white hair and a bag of gift for the children, thi amownaroz wore green symbol of spring) and red. he wa ush in by a sort of spring clown, hajefyrouz, who danc and play a tambourine. the zoroastrian from india were charmed. \"thi is all new for us, too,\" one told a visitor who ask what wa go on. a visitor, john a. sabanovich of folsom, said he becam intrigu with the religion year ago while on busi trip to iran. zoroastrian have no procedur for accept convert - a result, some say, of their centuri of persecut in iran follow by their promis to the hindu king who allow them into india that they would not interfer with hi people' religion. but that doe not stop sabavich from join in the celebr at the san jose templ whenev he can. \"when i first heard about thi religion,\" he said, \"i thought, my god, thi is what a religion should be. they think for themselv and do good. \"peopl who don't have a tradition, someth to lean on, what' the differ with the lower animals?\" ------------------------------------------------ end of articl

matthew doe not say that juda did not fall; neither doe peter say that juda did not hang himself. thi is not a matter of one person call someth black and the other person call it white. both account can be true and supplementary. a possibl reconstruct would be this: juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave way and juda fell down the ledge, mangl hi bodi in the process. the fall could have been befor *or* after death as either would fit thi explanation. thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock on thi way down, tear hi bodi open. it is import to rememb that we are not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall. loui gaussen relat a stori of a man who wa determin to kill himself. thi individu place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at hi head. he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time. on the other hand, a person could say that thi man took hi life by shoot himself, while anoth could rightli contend he commit suicid by jump form the tall building. in thi case, both are true, as both are true in the case of matthew' and peter' account of the death of judas. it is mere a situat of differ perspect of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ your onli reason for reject thi is, i believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy. you haven't relat how thi is imposs or highli unlikely. here' what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ db [quot toni rose]... > there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. > therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock > on thi way down, tear hi bodi open. it is import to rememb that we > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > are not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall. \"the ad text in thi version is so heavi that, assum you are truli so oppos to such tactics, you should find it not credible. but you seem to find toni rose' eisegesi satisfactory, while clearli reject david joslin's.\" _____________________________________________________________________ here, you discredit tony' explan base on what you deem too \"heavy\" for the passages. but you haven't address whi you feel that way. you can say it' a vain attempt to reconcil the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown whi you reject that possibility. questions: is matthew lie or is luke lying?

_____________________________________________________________________ although i still agre with tony' exegesi as be the most probabl explan regard judas' death (take into account sever criteria), i'v recent notic some new thing in matthew. mat 27:5-8 then he threw down the piec of silver in the templ and departed, and went and hang himself. but the chief priest took the silver piec and said, \"it is not law to put them into the treasury, becaus they are the price of blood.\" and they consult togeth and bought with them the potter' field, to buri stranger in. therefor that field ha been call the field of blood to thi day. first of all, notic that the text doe not say that juda die as a result of hanging. all it say is that he \"went and hang himself.\" luke however, in acts, tell us that \"and fall headlong, he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out.\" thi is a pretti clear indic (along with the other detail given in act - peter' speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after judas' fall, he wa dead. so the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highli probable, but not clear

mat 27:6 but the chief priest took the silver piec and said, \"it is not law to put them into the treasury, becaus they are the price of blood.\" mat 27:7 and they consult togeth and bought with them the potter' field, to buri stranger in. mat 27:8 therefor that field ha been call the field of blood to thi day. notic vers 5...\"then he...went and hang himself.\" matthew doe not say juda died, doe

_____________________________________________________________________ a possibl reconstruct would be this: juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave way and juda fell down the ledge, mangl hi bodi in the process. the fall could have been befor *or* after death as either would fit thi explanation. thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock on thi way down, tear hi bodi open.

hand the author is correct: matthew doe make that confusion. of cours a biblic inerrantist who claim that everi word of the bibl is guarante true by god, will have to therebi add one more contradict to the death of juda (ie: where the prophesi of the potter' field came from).\" my reply... please, when we are done with thi studi on hi death, remind me to discuss thi with you. db... as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which juda purchas the land, wa inde for the betrayal, rather than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specif mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [act 1:18], it also specif mention what act of iniqu they were talk about (ie: act 1:16 \"...concern juda who wa guid to those who arrest jesus.\"). now i would point out that when the bibl describ an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immedi discuss \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inan to suggest that it wa an action of iniqu other than the one discussed.\" my reply... dave, we are get somewhere, aren't we! act 1:15 and in those day peter stood up in the midst of the discipl (altogeth the number of name wa about a hundr and twenty), and said, act 1:16 \"men and brethren, thi scriptur had to be fulfilled, which the holi spirit spoke befor by the mouth of david concern judas, who becam a guid to those who arrest jesus; act 1:17 \"for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministry.\" act 1:18 (now thi man purchas a field with the wage of iniquity; and fall headlong, he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out. act 1:19 and it becam known to all those dwell in jerusalem; so that field is call in their own language, akel dama, that is, field of blood.) act 1:20 \"for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let hi dwell place be desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let anoth take hi office.' notic that in vers 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used. rather, it state that juda \"becam a guid to those who arrest jesus\". but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, \"for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministry.\" what part did juda play in their ministry? ^^^^^^ joh 12:6 thi he said, not that he care for the poor, but becaus he wa a thief, and had the money box; and he use to take what wa put in it. joh 13:29 for some thought, becaus juda had the money box, that jesu had said to him, \"buy those thing we need for the feast,\" or that he should give someth to the poor. so, now we know what part juda play - he wa a treasurer, per se. right after peter state that juda play a part in thi ministri (treasurer, accord to john), then luke add the parenthet explan of \"wage of iniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but wa stolen by juda to purchas a field. i believ thi is a better exeget explan of what the \"wage of iniquity\" are. what do you think, dave? db... \"now sinc i have given you clear answer (and even references), perhap you could unequivoc state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of ask me what type i think you are, as you did to mr joslin).\" my reply... i will gladli admit that i am a complet inerrantist, although i

admit ignor and incompet in thi example). thu i felt honor bound to do a better set of research specif on the word. first it should be note that greek grammar is not as tough as i first assum (it is not nontrivi by ani means, and i still am not compet with it, but it is not as opaqu as i had thought). it turn out that while the index for the bauer-arndt-gingrich \"greek lexicon\" render each vers in order, each word within a vers is put in greek alphabet order. thu while the the mean of the vers is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear. on the other hand, a greek-english intralinear bibl make thing a lot more comprehendable. and yes, the word for field in act 1:18 is inde \"chorion.\" now i'v check sever greek-english lexicons: \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" louw and nida \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament\" \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" grimm \"word studi concordance,\" tynsdal \"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian writings,\" bauer-arndt-gingrich \"the new analyt greek lexicon,\" perschbach in each case the mean of the word chorion wa given various as: a space, place, region, district, field, area, \"countri place,\" land, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings. nowher do ani of these book mention anyth about \"grave.\" as some of these book go into great detail, i would be veri surpris to find that these book are all inadequ and mr archer is the onli compet scholar in greek. i think it more like that mr archer' investig into \"contradictions\" to be onc again, as your friend said it, \"lack in substance,\" and thu archer is again shown worthless as an expert wit (bi the way mr decenso, i would have honor present my result on thi matter, even if i had found them to support mr archer' contentions). by the way, among these lexicons, (eg: robinson's) is the definit of \"agros,\" the word use in matthew 27 to describ the field bought. the word \"agros\" is defin as \"a field in the country.\" chorion is specif note as a synonym to agros. thi is significant, as it is evid of how silli bullinger' exegisi was, which state that the word for \"field\" in matthew (ie: agros) is differ from the word for \"field\" in act (ie: chorion), and thu we must be talk about two differ field (of cours you alreadi admit how stupid bullinger' exegisi is, but thi wa a small serendip which drive the point home). so as of now, unless mr decenso show compel reason to believ otherwis (eg: a reput scholar with reput references), i consid thi particular issu closed. see mr decenso, now you can go on to answer question about the denial of peter, the day of the crucifixion, tyre, and the fact that the author of matthew quot from the wrong prophet in discuss the \"potter' field.\" later, dave butler precis knowledg is the onli true knowledge, and he who doe not teach exactly, doe not teach at all. henri ward beecher american clergyman as record by

research as to the greek word \"apacgw,\" you will find that it doe denot success. those scholar did inde have an excel reason to assum that the suicid wa successful. as i point out, i recent check sever lexicons: \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" louw and nida \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament\" \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" grimm \"word studi concordance,\" tynsdal \"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian writings,\" bauer-arndt-gingrich \"the new analyt greek lexicon,\" perschbach a coupl simpli state \"hang oneself\", and a coupl were more explicit and state that \"apacgw\" mean specif \"kill yourself by hanging.\" a coupl also note that the mean of one the root word for \"apacgw\" is \"strangle, throttl or choke\" (which pretti much invalid the guy who suggest to david joslin that juda wa hung upsid down). one of the best refer though, \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament,\" not onli state the translation, it gave both the root words, the liter translation, relat greek word which use the same roots, and also other present specif exampl of the word in greek literatur (to give further context). the word \"apagchw\" ha two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and the root word \"apo\" mean liter \"away.\" thi root word is includ in word which denot a transition. it can mean a transit in place (eg: the greek word \"apagello\" mean to send a message). \"apo\" can also denot a chang in state and specif the chang from life to death. robinson specif make comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which mean \"to kill.\" in liter mean the word \"apacgw\" mean \"to throttle, strangl to put out of the way,\" and implicitli denot a chang in life state (ie: away from life, to death). so while the word \"apacgw\" doe mean \"to hang,\" it specif denot a death as well. thu robinson is quit specif when he state that it mean \"to hang oneself, to end one' life by hanging.\" he then note the the use of \"apacgw\" in homer odessi 19:230 to denot context. he present that exampl of \"apacgw\" as be use to explicitli mean \"suicid by hanging.\" now sinc there is a perfectli good word for strangling, without the ad denot of \"death,\" and as you insist that the bibl wa written by god, and everi word is precic correct, you are stuck with the complet mean of \"apacgw\" (ie: sinc the word \"apacgw\" wa used, then death is denot as the result). by the way, i note that mr decenso also present an exampl of \"apacgw\": > in the septuagint (the greek translat of the ot use at the time of jesus), > it' onli use in 2 samuel 17:23 : \"now when ahithophel saw that hi advic > wa not followed, he saddl a donkey, and aros and went home to hi house,

\"hang himself\" [gr. sept., > apagcho], but it explicitli adds, \"and died\". here we have no doubt of the > result. > in matthew, we are not explicitli told juda died. note mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint wa a translat from hebrew to greek, and you have not shown the origin mean of the hebrew (ie\" the the hebrew say \"and died\"), and thu whether it wa simpli echo in the greek. it should also be point out that, regardless of the ad \"and died\", the correct translat would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did inde die from strangul (redundant, but correct). further, we have evid that the septuagint wa repeatedli rewritten and reedit (which includ version which contradict each other), and such edit wa not even necessarili execut by greeks. thu i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek. so, what you realli need to prove your point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someon commit \"apacgw\" and surviving. otherwis i would see you as simpli make worthless assert without correspond evidence. now i would note mr decenso, that everytim i go out of my way to research it one of your appar contriv exegisis, i pretti much find it false. thus, i think that if you are go to add to the text, someth over and abov what the sourc clearli says, then you had better have an explicit greek or histor sourc to justifi it. by the way, as to mr rose' statement about tree around the potter' field: > there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. unless mr rose can show that these tree are two thousand year old, or that there are 2000 year old stump there, or ha a 2 thousand year old descript of the area which mention such trees, then it is inappropri for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the locat of the tree two thousand year ago (after all, thing change). now as to your other argument, ie: that the money juda use is not the same as the 30 silvers: > as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which juda purchas the land, wa inde for the betrayal, rather > than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specif > mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [act 1:18], it also specif mention > what act of iniqu they were talk about (ie: act 1:16 \"...concern > juda who wa guid to those who arrest

not stop there...vs. 17, \"for he wa number with us and > obtain a part in thi ministry.\" what part did juda play in their ministry? > ^^^^^^ true, peter (or the author of acts) doe not specif call judas' betray \"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither doe john specif call judas' action \"an iniquity\" either. further john 13:29 did not say that juda took the money box, but rather said: \"some thought that because, juda had the money box, jesu wa tell him \"buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give someth to the poor, so after receiv the morsel he immedi went out, and it wa night.\" note that it is said that juda left, it doe not say that he took the money box. thu when i see your explan it still seem to me you would choos the a an unproven iniquity, mention by anoth author, in a differ book, written at a differ time, over the iniqu explicitli mention by the author of acts. i find thi forc and contrived. of cours thi particular argument becom moot, sinc we have have seen evid that \"apacgw\" mean suicide. you see, sinc judas' hang wa successful, he could not have spent the money mention in john 13:29, becaus matthew and mark explicitli say the betray wa on the high holi day (ie: passover), and thu he could not have spent the money befor kill himself the next day. thu the money which bought the \"field of blood\" would have to have been the 30 piec of silver (of cours he got the 30 piec of silver that night as well, and thu couldn't have spent that either. oh dear, i believ that the hous of card is com down). mayb we should at thi point, discuss now whether jesu wa crucifi on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas. by the way, as to where the prophesi of the potter' field came from (ie: the mention of it in matthew), you say: > please, when we are done with thi studi on hi death, remind me to discuss > thi with you. i am remind you now to discuss it now. it' all part of the same vers we are discussing, and i wish you would quit procrastin and sidestep these issues. later, dave butler a wise man proport hi belief to the evidence. david hume, philosoph an inquiri concern human understand ps. i would note again, that you are not state that that bibl is not possibl inerrant; you are state that it *is* inerrant. sinc you have been, by your own admission, present mere \"possible\" reconcili (i of

end both their romanc and their busi partnership, caligiuri wa sexual assault by a man he pick up in a bar. \"i wa realli drunk,\" he recalls, \"and i went home with thi guy. he tie me up and rape me. he left me tie up all night, and the next morn he rape me again.\" when caligiuri wa eventu freed by the attacker, he return home to the home he share with hi ex-lover. \"he had anoth man there with him,\" caligiuri recalls. \"i thought at thi time, 'if thi is what be gay is about, i don't want to be thi way anymore.\" caligiuri vow that if he could find a way out, he would share hi discoveri with others. he organ an antigay conting to demonstr at phoenix' gay pride parad in june 1985, and a few month later free inde held it first public protest. at a meet to promot a gay civil right ordinance, free inde member loudli blast gays, tell them ther were sinner head for hell. free inde began receiv about a hundr telephon call a week, thank in part to a decept list in the local yellow

preach to them about the sin of homo- sexuality.\" ruse like thi are typic of the movement, caligiuri says, adding, \"they'll do anyth to reach these people.\" \"david use to go on radio and say realli stupid things,\" recal peter kelly, a counselor at phoenix' cathol dioces aid program, \"like that he knew he wa gay when he start wear pastel colors.\" caligiuri' famili first found out about hi ministri when they saw him on raphael' syndic talk show in 1985. \"they were relieved,\" he recalls. \"they figur that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that i should be a 'reformed' gay person.\" but caligiuri wa hardli reformed. \"bi the time i appear on sally' show,\" \"i'd start have sex with men again. men would call our hotlin and tell me about thier latest sin:

\"i'd convinc myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says. today, caligiuri, 31, is studi altern spiritu (\"i'm interest- ed in belief system that aren't judgemental.\"), consid romanc (\"but not with a christian!\"), and search for a new project to devot himself to. \"i feel compel to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says. \"i want to eventu stop feel guilti about what i did and make up for the damag i may have brought to our community.\" ---end article--- caligiuri' tori is by no mean uniqu and i have read sever other articl of former leader and founder of 'ex-gay' ministri who have said veri similar th similar things. fortuant not all of them have left christianity, but have come to realiz that god love them despit the attitud of others. some, like chri glaser, director of the presbyterian \"lazaru project\" of west hollywood presbyterian church have actual been work with the gay commun to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encourag real ethic valu of sexual within the sphere of be gay. i have also, as i said talk and becom and becom close friend with mani who onc attend such group as \"love in action\" and others, who either onc claim to have been \"reformed\" or who were too honest with themselv to live a lie, no matter who wa disappoint in them. some were even encourag to marri as a way of \"sealing\" their new heterosexuality, onli to eventu start hit the bars, bathhous and bookstores, sinc these were usual activ under the conceal of night and one-night-stand of promiscu behavior meant no continu \"sin\" through a commit relationship. thi is a horribl trap which the church ha dump on the back of the truli gay orient people, and the veri inno- cent victim in these case are the wive and children of such marriages. yet the church insist that there are onli two option they are will to allow gay people: 1) heterosexu or 2) celebacy. thi is sad. what is also mrtifying, is in the case of those who cannot suppress their desir and fear for thier saniti in such a mix up confus that the church forc on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgic damper of the brain functions. in the past lobotomi and heavey drug suppress were common- place. there are now becom avail more and more literatur on the threat of coerciv christian toward gays, such as sylvia pennington' _\"ex-gays? there are none_. and others. there are also a great mani fact base book be written to help peopl trap in thi confus such as mauri johnston' _gay under grace_, and chri glaser' _come hom!_. i serious recommend those for

usage, definit six or eight might apply. note that these definit do not mean the same thing. in my mind, to say that scienc ha it basi in valu is a bit of a reach. scienc ha it basi in observ fact. even the usag of the word \"value\" abov do not denot observ fact, but rather a standard of measurement. i would conclud that scienc doe not have it basi in values, and so your statement abov fails. in fact, if one conclud that a scientif set of measur (values) are base on system deriv from observation, then it must follow that in a scientif context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \"object values.\" back to the present. thi ha noth to do with a moral system anyhow. just becaus the word \"values\" is use in both context doe not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts. if one is to argu for object valu (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstr that moral itself is objective. consid the mean of the word \"objective\" i doubt that thi

(a discuss of the issu in more or less these term is record in act 15.) howev there' more involved. in order to get a full pictur of the role of the law, we have to come to grip with paul' appar reject of the law, and how that relat to jesus' commend of the law. at least as i read paul, he say that the law serv a purpos that ha been in a certain sens superceded. again, thi issu isn't one of the abolit of the law. in the middl of hi discussion, paul note that he might be understood thi way, and assur us that that' not what he intend to say. rather, he see the law as primarili be present to convict peopl of their sinfulness. but ultim it' an imposs standard, and one that ha been superced by christ. paul' comment are not the world' clearest here, and not everyon agre with my reading. but the interest thing to notic is that even thi radic posit doe not entail an abolit of the law. it still remain as an uncompromis standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. for it purpos of convict of sin, it' import that it not be relaxed. howev for christians, it' not the end -- ultim we live in faith, not law. while the theoret categori they use are rather different, in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclusion. the quot passag from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount, where jesu show us how he interpret the law. the \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather liter reading, but in fact that' not jesus' approach. jesus' interpret emphas the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremoni details. inde he is well known for take a rather free attitud toward the sabbath and kosher laws. some scholar claim that mat 5:17-20 need to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish discussions. jesu accus hi oppon of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglect the thing that realli matter: justice, merci and faith, and care about how cup and plate are cleaned, but not about the fact that insid the peopl who use them are full of extort and rapacity. (mat 23:23-25) this, and the discuss later in mat 5, suggest that jesu ha a veri specif view of the law in mind, and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength, he is think of these aspect of it. paul' conclus is similar. while he talk about the law be superceded, all of the specif exampl he give involv the \"ceremoni law\", such as circumcis and the sabbath. he is quit concern about maintain moral standards. the net result of thi is that when paul talk about the law be superceded, and jesu talk about the law be maintained, i believ they are talk about differ aspect of the law. paul is embroil in argument about circumcision. as is natur in letter respond to specif situations, he' look at the aspect of the law that is current caus trouble: the law as specif jewish ceremonies. he certainli doe not intend to abolish divin standard of conduct. on the other hand, when jesu commend the law, he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implic for moral and human relationships, and deemphas those aspect that were later to give paul so much trouble. it' unfortun that peopl use the same term in differ ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the way term like \"famili values\" take on special mean from the current context. imagin some poor historian of the futur tri to figur out whi \"famili values\" should be use as a code word for opposit to homosexu in one specif period in the u.s. i think law had taken on a similar role in the argument paul wa involv in. paul wa clearli not reject all of the jewish valu that go along with the term \"law\", ani more than peopl who concern about the \"famili values\" movement are realli oppos to famili values. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83535 from:

read your post, it wa noth new, i had seen much the same in other typical\"christian\" anti-gay sentiment literature. gay peopl are and will con- tinu to be persecut as long as such propaganda petpetuates. you may be unawar of all the statistica \"findings\" concern african-american that have been publish and use by variou group to re-enforc their own bia against african-americans. we usual think of the kkk in these instances, but there are mani other groups. of course, the vast major of the public scoff at such find and document today, but that wa not alway the case. fortun african-american had \"whites\" who support their 'cause' and public sentiment wa eventu (if not entirely) turn around. there wa even a civil war, and anti-negro sentiment increased. in fact, until law were put in place to protect the inalien right of black it wa pretti much legal to discrimin against them. i know mani gay and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination. you may think that i have been deceiv or something, that is your perogative. my church, christian church (discipl of christ) openli affirm the right of oppress peopl of all segment of society, includ gays. we believ the gospel messag of preach to all creation and make disciples. we believ in the lord' great command to love, and we beleiv in stand up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so. i realli like my church for last reason the most. i can find a church almost anywher in the valley that stand for the gospel and believ in the command of love (though i'm hard-press to find mani who actual sho love), but not mani are will to champion the oppressed, especi within their own community. i may have lost face with the greater christian commun for the unpopular of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionist against the oppress of african-americans. mani were even kill and treat as runaway slave for be \"nigger-lovers\" and such. i guess i'v decid the challeng is worth it. in my talk with gay men and women i have heard tragic stori after tragic stori center around fail marriages, wive and husband who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc. funni thing is, i don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continu to reject their gay famili member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like pflag. i'm apal by the legisl which pass in colorado, and am equal out0 rage that such slimey peopl as loui sheldon (from the tradit valu coalition) have been activ work in the christian underground to garner support within sever (8 i believe) state thi come novemb for more oppress legis against gays. perhap you don't get it, and mayb you never will. mani didn't get it in the middl age and the proclaim god' will be done as they massacr thousand in witch hunt and inquisitions. the messag that come through, loud and clear, by propon against gay right and against gay in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatr for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't chang the results). the major flaw in all thi postur is that in the end, the final effect of post like that of your and mr. hudson is that you have a \"conditional\" love for gays. condition: chang and we'll love you. thi is sure strang come from a group who claim that god ha an \"unconditional\" love, one that call peopl \"just as they are.\" sure there are thing that will 'naturally' change, and habit (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be chang through some sort of therapy. but then there are thing like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beat it out of people, is go to result in anyth more than an outward conforminti to \"other people' expectations.\" in the process thi coerc conform caus mani peopl a great deal of harm, especi when it is caus by peopl who have noth more to gain from it that to becom even more puf up about their own sens of pseuper-spirituality. thi is sad, but i thoroughli believ that one day it will change. it may be unpopular to cri for justic and equal when the basi ha to do with someth veri person like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but i firmli believ in the right of individu to be free from impos regul on thier bedrooms. it' funni that most straight peopl have success remov restrict and oppress legisl against invas legislation, but we like to maintain thi littl chestnut of repression...a though it help us maintain a sens of superior over at least one segment of society. gay peopl are not criminals. anoth interest thing happen recently. a veri promin charismat church in the silicon valley (here) had two of it' pastor arrest for self- admit charg of pederasti (men have sex with boys). thi had appar been go on for some time (a coupl years?), but sinc the charg were voluntary, and the church work close with the police, so i imagin that wa how they manag to downplay it in the media. how could such a thing happen when the church, itself, ha an ex-gay ministry? one of my friend recent told me he wa \"approached\" by someon who is go through the reparit therapi there, and he wa thoroughli convinc that the request for dinner wa not an invit to attend the ministry. these are difficult time we live in, but provid hostil environ and creat and perpetu an atmospher that breed hate and violenc is not the call of the christian community. the result of the pass amend in colorado ha creat an organ who' poster are appear all over colorado call \"s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t.\" (i forget the whole definit off hand, but the last part wa against immor gross homosexu trash) and their motto is \"work for a fag-fre america\" with an implicit advoc for violence. thi is sick, and it seem to be what you and mr. hudson, and other are embracing. we christian have a loooooooooong tradit of coersion and oppress toward those we feel don't 'measur up', and constant berat from organ like

if you will bear with me, i will attempt to explain thi appar inconsist from at least one christian' viewpoint: if god exist and is the creator of mankind as the bibl claims, then he ha a pretti well-defin concept of what make peopl tick physically, emotionally, etc. god ha an \"objective\" moral for us. that is to say, he ha no troubl understand what is good for (or detriment to) the creatur he created. galatian 2:10-- for we [mankind] are hi workmanship, creat in christ jesu for good work [a morality], which god prepar beforehand [a well-defin design], that we might walk in them. however, contrari to what mani peopl assum (includ the pharase of the bible,) god' moral cannot be complet codifi in a list of rule and regulations. to some extent, everi activ of a person' life creat a new situat to which moral must be applied. there never could be enough volum to codifi god' \"objective\" moral for us. throughout history, mankind ha tri to reduc moral to a list of rule (objectivity, if you please.) in the old testament, we have both principl and specif rules. by the time of jesus, most of the principl were obscur by the emphasi men had place on the rules. volum of addit rule had been made to tri to codifi the applic of the principles. we [mankind] weren't comfort with the \"subjectivity\" of principles. for refer see matthew 5 where jesu explain the differ between the law and the principl of the law. for example, in vers 21-22: \"you have heard that the ancient were told, 'you shall not commit murder'...and 'whoever commit murder shall be liabl to the court.' but i say to you that everyon who is angri with hi brother shall be liabl to the court...\" the \"object morality\" of god get blur by our inept interpret of it. we [christians] have made our biggest error when we have allow ani one person or group of peopl decid exactli what god intend for us. if we [christians] would stay commit to seek god' will instead of tri to prove we alreadi had it all figur out, we might do a better job of allow other to find god' \"object morality\" for themselves. if jesu is who he said he was/i (and that' the fundament question,) then he is \"object morality.\" john nunnal newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83621 from: dmcgee@uluhe.soest.hawaii.edu (don mcgee) subject: feder hear fact or rumor....?

and how doe one go about >love god? well, the whole *point* of make these the \"base\" command is that they *aren't* reduc to rules. a set of rule is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting. such thing can be veri help to individu or societi -- but not if they are use *instead* of a person involv in and respons for one' actions. the great command is, more than anyth else, a call to act *a if you were god and accept ultim responsibility* in your everi action. a demand that i, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keep pop up nonetheless (along with the reassur that it is more import that i be open to tri this, than succeed at it). \"conservatives\" may twist thi \"act as if you were god\" to mean \"lay down rule for other peopl and be as nasti to them as possibl if they don't keep your rules.\" they are so insist (and obvious) about thi that they have convinc a lot of peopl (who rightli reject the whole concept!) that such idioci is how god acts. that, after all, is the standard accus \"against god\" by the atheist here and elsewhere. that the \"conservatives\" have confus their manipulative, hoop-jump notion of coerc other peopl with the natur of god is almost the entir content of standard american atheism -- and i quit agre with it on thi point. >ethic system are not differenti by the nice sound goo >up front, much of which sound pretti much the same, but by the >*specific* acts, procedures, and argument that they recommend. and differ bodi of christian have, from the beginning, urg *different* \"ethic systems\" (or in some cases, none). as a result, it is bizarr to identifi ani one of these systems, howev popular (or infamous) with christianity. christian doe not have a torah. it doe not have a qu'ran. specif christian scriptur ha veri little, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so littl that the \"christians\" who desper *want* command go \"mining\" for them with almost no support (and thu almost no obviou limit :-)) for their efforts. the one, single, thing in the gospel which jesu specif \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\" [i will be expand on thi point in a repli to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quit true that some christian infer lot of command from the nt; i'll point out what ha to be go on in these inferences, and whi there is a huge amount of \"cultur baggage\" involved.] you are quit right that thi is \"goo\" if one is look for an ethic system. but whi should anyon be look for an ethic system, sinc our societi is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

(that is simpli the way god set thing up in the universes.) therefore, all those christian who worship jesus, and pray to jesus, and expect jesu to return and save them from their sins, are onli kid themselves, and have allow themselv to be dupe by a religion that wa mostli manufactur by the romans. and emot \"feelings\" are a total deceiv indic for religi validity. these thing are similarli true for follow of most other major world religions, includ islam. thirdly, the primari function of each master is to tune hi initi into the \"audibl life stream\" or \"sound current\", (refer to as \"the word\" in john 1:1-5, and as \"the river of life\" in revel 22:1), and to person guid each of them thru the upper level of heaven while they are still connect to their live physic bodi by a \"silver cord\". true salvation, which complet a soul' cycl of reincarn in the physic and psychic planes, is achiev onli by reach at least the \"soul plane\", which is five level or univers abov the physic universe, and thi cannot be done without the help of a physically-liv divin master. one such divin master aliv today is an american, sri harold klemp, the live \"eck\" master or \"mahanta\" for the \"eckankar\" organization, now headquart in minneapolis, (p.o. box 27300; zip 55427). anoth divin master is maharaj gurind singh ji, now live in punjab, india, and is associ with the \"sant mat\" organization. one of the classic book on thi subject is \"the path of the masters\" (radha soami books, p.o. box 242, gardena, ca 90247), written in 1939 by dr. julian johnson, a theologian and surgeon who spent the last year of hi life in india studi under and close observ the sant mat master of that time, maharaj sawan singh ji. sever of the eckankar books, includ some author by sri paul twitchel or sri harold klemp, can be found in most public and univers librari and some book stores, or obtain thru inter-librari loan. the book \"eckankar--th key to secret worlds\", by sri paul twitchell, is anoth classic. mani christian are like to confus the master with the \"anti-christ\", which is or wa to be a temporari world dictat dure the so-cal \"last days\". but the master don't ever rule, even when ask or expect to do so as jesu was. peopl who continu follow christianity, islam, or other orthodox religion with a physically-dead master, will continu on their cycl of reincarnation, between the psychic plane and thi miser physic world, until they final accept initi from a physically-liv divin master. re-incarn the book \"here and hereafter\", by ruth montgomery, describ sever kind of evid support reincarn as a fact of life, includ hypnot regress to past live [about 50% accurate; the subconsci mind sometim make thing up, especi with a bad hypnotist], spontan recal (especi by young children, some of whom can identifi their most recent previou relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), dream recal of past life experi- ences, deja vu (familiar with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read- ing of the late edgar cayce, and even support statement from the christian bibl includ matthew 17:11-13 (john the baptist wa the reincarn of elias.) and john 9:1-2 (how can a person possibl sin befor he is born, unless he live before?!). [ alway use the \"king jame version\". later version are per-versions! ] strong interests, innat talents, strong phobias, etc., typic origin from a person' past lives. for example, a strong fear of swim in or travel over water usual result from have drown at the end of a previou life. and sometim a person will take an immedi dislik to anoth person be met for the first time in thi life, becaus of a bad encount with him dure a previou incarnation. the teach of reincarn also includ the law of karma (galatian 6:7, revel 13:10, etc.). peopl would behav much better toward each other if they knew that their action in the present will sure be reap by them in the future, or in a futur incarnation! \"2nd comings\" if a divin master physic die (\"translates\") befor a particular initi of hi does, then when that initi physic die (\"translates\"), the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directli to the soul plane. thi is the one and onli correct mean of a 2nd coming. it is an individu experience, not someth that happen for everyon all at once. peopl who are still wait for jesus' \"2nd coming\" are wait in vain. plane of exist the physic univers is the lowest of at least a dozen major level of existence. abov the physic plane is the astral plane, the causal plane, the mental plane, the ether plane (often count as the upper part of the mental plane), the soul plane, and sever higher spiritu planes. the soul plane is the first true heaven, (count upward from the physical). the plane between (but not including) the physic and soul plane are call the psychic planes. it is like that esp, telepathy, astrolog influences, radion effects, biolog transmut [see the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without an appar physic origin, result from interact between the psychic plane and the physic plane. the major plane are also sub-divided. for example, a sub-plan of the astral plane is call \"hades\", and the christian hell occupi a small part of it, creat there less than 2000 year ago by the earli cathol church by some kind of black magic or by simpli teach it exist in a threaten manner. the christian \"heaven\" is locat elsewher on the astral plane. good christian will go there for a short while and then reincarn back to earth. sound current vs. blind faith the christian religion demand of it follow an extraordinari amount of blind faith back up by littl more than good feel (which is total deceiving). if a person is not hear some form of the \"sound current\" (\"the word\", \"the bani\", \"the audibl life stream\"), then hi cycl of reincarn in thi miser world will continue. the \"sound current\" manifest differ for differ initiates, and can sound like a rush wind, ocean wave on the sea shore, buzz bees, higher-pitch buzz sound, a flute, variou heavenli music, or other sounds. in eckankar, member start hear it near the end of their first year as a member. thi and other experi (such as \"soul travel\") replac blind faith. for more information, answer to your questions, etc., pleas consult my cite sourc (3 books, 2 addresses). un-alt reproduct and dissemin of thi import inform is encouraged. robert e. mcelwain 2nd initi in eckankar, (but not an agent thereof) newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83805 from: joshua@cpac.washington.edu (joshua geller) subject: re: rosicrucian order(s) ?! in articl <1qppef$i5b@usenet.ins.cwru.edu> ch981@cleveland.freenet.edu (toni alicea) writes: > kent: > you say that > >there are about 4-10 compet rosicrucian order exist today, ^^^^^^^^^ > >most of them are spin-off from oto and other compet organ > >from the 19th centuri france/germany. mayb i should write an articl > pleas don't! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ huh?

boyce, 1982). the term is probabl of median origin, given that herodotu mention the \"magoi\" as one of the six tribe of the medes. for a varieti of reason we can consid the magi to have been member of a priestli tribe of median origin in western iran. among the persians, they were respons for liturg functions, as well as for maintain their knowledg of the holi and the occult. most likely, the supremaci of the median priesthood in western iran becam establish dure the time of the median monarchi that domin the persian from the end of the eighth centuri through the first half of the sixth centuri bce until the revolt of cyru the great (550 bce). the persian were indebt to the mede for their polit and civil institut as well. even if hypothes have been advanc concern the exist of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period (boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of median origin. thi is demonstr by the eposid of the revolt of gaumata the magian, mention by dariu i (522-486 bce) in the inscript at bisutun (iran), as well as by greek sources. indeed, herodotu insist on the idea of the usurpatori power of the mede against the persian through the conspiraci of the magi. the fact that the magi may have been member of a tribe that hand down the sacerdot art in a hereditari fashion natur did not exclud the possibl that some of them undertook secular prefessions. thi seem to be attest by the elamit tablet at persepolis. there is a theses, put forth by giusepp messina, that deni that the magi are member of an ethnic group by suggest that they are simpli member of the priesthood - a priesthood of pure zoroastrian origin. thi thesi is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesi that their name is relat to the avestan term magavan, deriv from the gathic maga (vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is not without foundat (mole, 1963). the mean of maga can probabl be found, in conform with the pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separ of the \"mixture\" of the two oppos principl of spirit and matter. the maga, which ha been erron interpret as \"chorus,\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (nyberg, 1966) and ha been render simpli by an express like unio mystica, seem to be an ecstat condit that open the mind to spiritu vision. in ani case, though there may be a relat between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinct between the magi and the avestan priesthood. the avesta ignor the median or old persian term, despit a recent hypothesi propos by h.w. bailey; old persian inscript ignor the avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (vedic, athravan), even if thi is perhap present in an achaeminid set in the elamit tablet of persepoli (gershevitch, 1964). the term magu ha been present in zoroastrian throughout it history; the pahlavi term mogh-mard and mobad repres it continuation. the latter in particular deriv from an older form, magupati (\"head of the magi\"). dure the sasanid period (third to seventh centuri ce), which saw the format of a hierarch organ church, the titl mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of high priests\") came to be use to design the summit of the ecclesiast hierarchy. the magi practic consanguin marriage, or khvaetvadatha (av.; pahl., khwedodah). they also perform a characterist funer rite: the exposur of the corps to anim and vultur to remov the flesh and therebi cleans it. the corps wa not suppos to decompose, lest it be contamin by the demon of putrefaction. thi practic later becam typic of the entir zoroastrian commun and led to the rise of a complex funer ritual in iran and among the parsi in india. stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especi for thi rite. dure the time of herodotu the practic of exposur of the corps wa in vogu onli among the magi; the persian gener sprinkl the corps with wax, then buri it. the practic wa widespread, however, among the peopl of central asia. the magi were the technician of and expert on worship: it wa imposs to offer sacrific without the presenc of a magus. dure the perform of a ritual sacrifice, the magu sang of the theogoni (the magi were possibl the custodian of a tradit of sacr poetry, but we know noth about the relationship of thi tradit to the variou part of the avesta) and wa call upon to interpret dream and to divin the future. the magi were also known for the practic of kill harmful, or \"ahrimanical,\" anim (khrafstra) such as snake and ants. they dress in the median style, wear pants, tunics, and coat with sleeves. they wore a characterist head cover of felt (gr. tiara) with strip on the side that could be use to cover the nose and mouth dure ritual to avoid contamin consecr object with their breath (boyce, 1982). the color of these caps, in conform with a tradit that is probabl of indo-european origin, accord to georg dumezil, wa that of the priesthood: white. in all likelihood, dure the achaemenid period the magi were not in possess of a well-defin bodi of doctrine, and it is probabl that they gradual adopt zoroastrianism; they were most like a clergi consist of profession priest who were not tie to a rigid orthodoxi but were natur inclin to eclectic and syncretism. nonetheless, they must have been jealou guardian of the patrimoni of zorastrian traditions. by virtu of thi they were the educ of the royal princes. the wisest of them wa respons for teach the princ the \"magic of zarathushtra, son of horomazes\" and thu the \"cult of the gods.\" magi who excel in other virtu were entrust with the educ of the princ so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself. dure the achaemenid period the magi maintain a posit of great influence, although they were certainli subordin to the emperor. despit sever dramat event such as the massacr they suffer after the death of gaumata the magian - in which, accord to herodotu (who call himself smerdis), the persian kill a larg number of magi to aveng the usurp - the magi nevertheless manag to maintain their influenc at court in media, in persia, and in the variou region of the empir where they were station as a consequ of the persian civilian and militari administration. no priesthood of antiqu wa more famou than that of the magi. they were renown as follow of zarathushtra (zoroaster); as the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker (pythagoras, democritus, plato); as the wise men who arrived, guid by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem; and as the propag of a cult of the sun in india. but they were also known as the chaldeans, the priesthood of babylon, known for it occultism; thi wa perhap the reason that the term mago had a pejor sens in greek, like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (bidez and cumont, 1938). indeed, the chaldean were expert in all type of magic arts, especi astrology, and had a reput for wisdom as well as knowledge. to understand the reason for such variou and sometim discord views, it is necessari to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-cal western magi, who were later hellenized. in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian, but the western magi (those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor, syria, mesopotamia, and armenia), who came in contact with divers religi traditions, must have, sooner or later and in vari degrees, been influenc by syncret concepts. the greek were familiar with both kind of magi and, depend on their vari concerns, would emphas one or the other aspect of them. classic historian and geographers, includ herodotu and strabo, document their customs, while the philosoph dwell abov all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, magian cosmolog and cosmogony, and their theolog and eschatology. those sourc most interest in the doctrin of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus. in do so they are repeat what the magi themselv said from the median and achaemenid periods, when they adopt zoroastrianism. at that time they embrac zarathushtra as one of their own and place themselv under hi vener name. zoroastrian had alreadi undergon sever profound transform in the eastern commun by the time of the acheamenid and wa alreadi adapt those element of the archaic religion that refus to die. it ha been said quit often, in an attempt to character the precis role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition, that the vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjur daivas\"), part of the avesta, should be attribut to them. (thi collect of text from variou period is primarili concern with purificatori rule and practices.) nonetheless, the hypothesi is hardli plausible, sinc the first chapter of the vendidad - a list of sixteen land creat by ahura mazda, the suprem god of zoroastrianism, but contamin by an attack by ahriman (pahl.; gathic-avestan, angra mainyu), the other suprem god and the ultim sourc of all evil and suffer - doe not mention western iran, persia, or media (the land of ragha mention in the text cannot be median raghiana). furthermore, it ha been note (gershevitch, 1964) that if the author had been magi the absenc of ani refer to western iranian institutions, includ their own priesthood, would be veri strange. the magi were abov all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradit and the corpu of the avesta have been transmit to us, from the second half of the first millennium bce on. thi ha been their princip merit. we can attribut directli to the magi the new formul that iranian dualism assumed, known to us especi from greek sourc and, in part, from the pahlavi literatur of the ninth and tenth centuri ce. accord to thi formulation, the two pole of the dualism are no longer, as in the gathas, spenta mainyu (\"benefic spirit\") and angra mainyu (\"hostil spirit\") but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu (gershevitch, 1964). [see ahura mazda and angra mainyu.] thi trans- format wa of immens consequ for the histor develop of zoro- astrian and wa most like determin by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religi world. in thi new dualism - which wa that later known to the greek (aristotle, eudemu of rhodes, theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirm of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism, to which we give the name zurvanism. [see zurvanism.] thank to their adher to zoroastrianism, the magi play an enorm import role in the transmiss of zarathushtra' treachings, as well as in the definit of the new form that these would assum historically. their natur propens to eclectic and syncret also help the diffus of zoroastrian idea in the commun of the iranian diaspora. the greek began to studi their doctrin and to take an interest in them (xanthu of lydia, hermodorus, aristotle, theopompus, hermippus, dinon), even write treatis on the persian religion, of which onli the titl and a few fragment have survived. in the hellenist period, the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and write on magic, astrology, and alchemi were lent the author of such prestigi name as zarathushtra, ostanes, and hystaspes, form an abund apocryph literature. (bidez and cumont, 1938). later still, eschatolog and apocalypt were a fertil meet ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions, as can be seen in the famou _oracl of hystaspes_, a work whose iranian root are undeni and which most like date from the begin of the christian era, probabl the second centuri ce (widengren, 1968). the zoroastrian doctrin of the savior of the futur (saoshyant) wa the basi for the stori of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ (2:1-12). [see saoshyant.] the sasanid period saw the magi onc again play a determin role in the religi histori of iran. concern to win back the western magi (de menasce, 1956), and eager to consolid zoroastrian as the nation religion of iran, the priest of iranian sanctuari in media and persia were abl to establish a true state church, strongli hierarch and endow with an orthodoxi base on the format of a canon of scriptures. the lead figur in the develop of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxi were tosar and kerder, the persecutor of mani in the third century. saoshyant: the avestan term saoshyant (\"futur benefactor\"; mpers., soshans) design the savior of the world, who will arriv at a futur time to redeem humankind. the concept of the futur savior is one of the fundament notion of zoro- astrianism, togeth with that of dualism; it appear as earli as in the gathas. zarathushtra (zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a sao- shyant, one who perform hi work for the frashokereti, the end of the present state of the world, when exist will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\" [see frashokereti] later zoroastrian doctrin develop thi notion into a true eschatolog myth and expand the number of saoshyant from one to three. all the savior are born from the seed of zarathushtra, which is preserv through the age in lake kansaoya (identifi with present-day lake helmand, in seistan, iran), protect by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. the greatest of the await saoshyants, the victori astvatereta (\"he who embodi truth\"), the son of the vispataurvairi (\"she who conquer all\"), is the third, who will make exist splendid; he appear in yasht 19. upon hi arriv humankind will no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be grant unlimit power. at that time the dead will be resurrected, and the live will be immort and indestructable. brandish the weapon with which he kill the power enemi of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and of asha), astvatereta will look upon the whole of corpor exist and render it imperishable. he and hi comrad will engag in a great battl with the forc of evil, which will be destroyed. the name astvatereta is clearli the result of theolog specul (kellens, 1974), as are those of hi two brothers, ukhshyatereta, \"he who make truth grow,\" and ukhshyatnemah, \"he who make rever grow\"; the name of the three virgin (yasht 13) who are impregn with the seed of zarathushtra when they bath in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants, are equal speculative. each of these saoshyant will arriv at the begin of a millennium, initi a new age and a new cycl of existence; astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind. the doctrin of the futur savior had alreadi taken shape in the archaemenid period (sixth to fourth centuri bce). it wa not, perhap the princip element in the format of the messian idea, but it wa certainli a determin factor, one that enjoy great success in the hellenist period beyond the confin of the iranian world. a similar concept, that of the futur buddha, maitreya, wa most like indebt to it, and christian messian can trace it root to the same source. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83818 from: pharvey@quack.kfu.com (paul harvey) subject: re: clarif of person posit in articl <c5rbht.fw4@athena.cs.uga.edu> hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (paul hudson jr) writes: >in articl <c5muiw.aqc@mailer.cc.fsu.edu> dlecoint@garnet.acns.fsu.edu (darius_lecointe) writes: >>if it were a sin to violat sunday no one could >>ever be forgiven for that for jesu never kept sunday holy. he onli >>recogn one day of the seven as holy. >jesu also recogn other holi days, like the passover. act 15 say >that no more should be lay on the gentil than that which is necessary. >the sabbath is not in the list, nor do ani of the epistl instruct peopl >to keep the 7th day, while christian were live among peopl who did not >keep the 7th day. it look like that would have been a problem. >instead, we have scriptur tell us that all day can be esteem alik >(roman 14:5) and that no man should judg us in regard to what kind of >food we eat, jewish holi day we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath.

have you ever lie to someone? even a littl white lie? have you ever claim to know someth that you realli didn't know? have you ever hate someone? have you ever been selfish? are you guilti of ani one of these? the answer is of course, yes. you are guilty. period. that is it what jesu is get at. no big surprise. feel do not even enter the picture. consid jesus' use of the word \"guilt\" as how a court use it. jesu is concern that everyon should admit that they are guilti of be imperfect. the bibl call it the state that we are all sinners. we all do bad things. even the most insignfic thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners. it is it in our natur to do bad things. we are sinners, therefor we do bad things. be a sinner is fact. it is not a pleasant fact. but it is just a fact. we are not perfect. call us sinner should have no more emot charg to you than call you a human being. guilti as charged. > and then there' thi singl person that will save you from thi > univers guilt feeling. you can handl your guilt in one of two ways: acknowledg you made a mistake, learn from it, and tri to not do it again--in the meantime, not punish yourself for it: which is the way jesu want you to handl or it. thi is the healthi way. or two, the destruct way: put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgiv yourself, forc yourself to say a thousand hail mari . . . even to suicide. thi the way jesu doe not want us to deal with it. all peopl fall into thi categori to some extent in their lives. jesu is not in the busi of save us from thi guilt feeling. jesu is in the busi of show us how much he love us despit our guilt. jesu know we are guilty. that isn't new to him. it is no big deal to him. he just want you to realiz that thi sin natur destroy the relationship between you and him. that is what he want you to know. why, becaus he want to have your company. you are immens valuabl to him. jesu want a relationship with you, however, in our present sin nature, we are incap of have thi relationship. god is perfect. we are not. you cannot fit a squar peg into a round hole. however, god ha provid a way for us to chang our natur so that we can have a relationship with him. god ha provid jesus, so that whosoev just believ in jesus, will have their natur changed. the holi spirit will move it. and now divin natur is now within live our veri being--and us and god commun with each through hi unifi holi spirit. the benefit of thi are endless. for with the divin natur live within us, we can now see our imperfect better. we can now head them off at the pass. with the power of the holi spirit live in us, we now have hi power to help us overcom our shortcomings. becaus the divin natur live within us, we can now understand profound bibl passag that never befor we could understand. becaus the divin natur now live within us, we now have author over demon forces. and lastly, becaus the divin natur now live within us, we have etern life--for the holi spirit is eternal. the relationship with jesu is of the utmost importance. becaus it is not what you do in life that qualifi you to belong to heavenli kingdom, it is your relationship to the live god. rememb what jesu said at the tail end of matthew when he separ the \"goat from the sheep\". mani peopl in the last day will ask him, \"didn't i prophesi in your name and do miracles, and do good thing in your name?\" and what did jesu say? \"depart from me, for i never *knew* you.\" that is the cornerston of christianity, kent. jesu must know you as hi friend. it is your relationship to jesus. if he is your friend and you are his, you will be count among those who will share in hi inherit in heaven. > brian, i will tell you a secret, i don't feel guilti at all, > i do mistakes, and i regret them, howev i'v never had thi > huge guilt feel hang over my shoulder. good. it show that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself. that is the second greatest command jesu taught. if onli more peopl could do as you do. as i said before, in the common english venacular, \"feel guilty\" ha a differ mean than the state of guilt. > thi all is a veri clear indic that you need a certain > person type in order to believ and adjust to certain > religi doctrines. and if your person type is > opposite, then you are not that easili attach to a certain > world view system. i believ what we all need in our person is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more uncondit love. > there are human that subscrib to the same notion. the nice > thing is that when you final shake off thi huge burden, > the shoulder feel far more relaxed! yes. you have state what jesu said. remember?

\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" thi is get a bit silli and the word \"objective\" is lose all meaning. let start by rememb the definit of \"objective\" which ha been alreadi presented: object adj. 1. of or have to do with a materi object as distinguish from a mental concept. 2. have actual existence. 3.a. unenfluenc by emot or person prejudice. b. base on observ phenomenon. the object of a thing is not base on whether everyon agre on that thing (eg: the world is object round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is base observ and verifi phenomenon (instead of be base sole on peopl wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). thu atoms, be base on veri observ and repeat phenomenon, are inde consid to be object rather than subjective. even weird, high energi physic is base on observ phenomenon (even though that observ can chang the outcome). nor are those observ phenomenon affect by emotion, or person prejudic (eg: chemic reaction do not chang to the whim of differ people). thu to say that scienc is not object (ie: object verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science. now i will agre that scienc is not object \"good;\" i will not therebi conclud though that scienc is not objective. now some exampl thing which are \"objective\": a d-12 tractor is larger than the averag breadbox. chlorophyl is green. seawat contain salt. there exist ozon in the atmospher (at least presently). ozon block ultraviolet light. ultraviolet light increas the incid of skin cancer. \"good\" on the other hand is a valu judgement. it doesn't seem to have an exist apart from what we give it (unless someon can object show the exist of an omnipot entiti which ha defin \"good\"). we cannot quantifi it, touch it or collect it in ani concret sens (eg: i have a bag full of \"good\"). now we do sometim attempt to give the word \"good\" an object meaning, e.g. \"good\" ha been use to denot strength, resiliency, speed, etc. that though, is a subject definition, as some might not see \"strength\" and etc, as necessarili \"good\" (eg: strength inspir by naziism is not gener view as \"good\"). as to a morality, i cannot say that i have ever seen a moral strictli base on verifi observ phenomenon. the closest i have seen is some form of the \"golden rule,\" which conclud that it is best not to deliber piss peopl off, as they will like then involv themselv in your life, in a manner you won't like. thi is verifiable; when you \"get in someone' face,\" they will often retaliate. anoth object fact about moral is that a more power group can enforc their moral on a weaker group, and thu can at times, ignor that form of the \"golden rule\" without fear of reprisal. now as to whether thi enforc of moral is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quit subjective. by the way, rememb that subject doe not mean that a thing cannot be formal stated, or even commonli agre upon; it onli mean that that it is not verifi from observ phenomena, or ha a physic exist unto itself. also note that i have not state that there is no such thing as an object morality, or that i could not accept ani such a morality; i have simpli state that i have seen no evid of ani such morality. one other thing to notice, \"objective\" is mani time use as synonym with \"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometim ha the connot of \"false\" and/or \"relative.\" tain't necessarili so. for instance, when a conclus is base on objective, but insuffici evidence, then it can be both object and false. as to \"absolute,\" it is easi to note that while we can object show that tnt is explosive, but that doe not absolut mean that all tnt will explode, and thu object is not necessarili absolut either. on the other hand, someth subject can also be either \"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" for instance, there are some theist who are specif \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have onli subject evid to back it up. further, mani a scientist and detect ha been motiv by subject reason (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to investig a phenomena or situation, and gather the object evid necessari to support a true hypothesis. on the whole though, i would have to agre that object evid is much more trustworthi than subject evidence. later, dave butler in start ani thesis, it seem to me, one should put

second, they didn't care. they want a confrontation. they want public and they got it. after the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming. they also said it would have been foolish to go in know that. well, we know now that they intercept the inform call and went in anyway. did they explor all of the possibl for end the seige? accord to them they did, but accord to the hartford courant, the woman that rais koresh (hi grandmother) wa not allow to go in and see him. the fbi agent who she spoke with wa bob rick and accord to the paper he said: \"a lot of peopl think if you just talk to them logic they will come out. hi grandmoth rais vernon howell; (koresh' real name) she didn't rais david koresh.\" someon who rais you and love you doe not speak to you strickli on a logic level. there is also an emot level on which they can reach you. here' anoth one. all dure thi oper the fbi ha been claim that they fear a mass suicid and that is one of the reason that someth must be done. now they claim they never thought he would do it? i knew they were go to do someth when they start talk about how much money thi wa costing. that wa the start of the \"justification\" part part of the plan. that' when i knew it would come soon. but, back to the plan. it is consid \"cruel and unus punishment\" to execut crimin in the mind of mani people, but look at what' acceptable. they knew the parent (adults) had ga masks. they did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them. so the plan wa to pour the ga into the compound. the mothers, see what the ga wa do to their children were suppos to run out and that would onli leav the men to deal with. i spent two year in the armi and like everyoth veteran i went through cbr (chemical, biolog radiological) warfar training. part of that train is go into a room fill with the same stuff that the children were subject to. to make the stuff realli interest the ga also ha a chemic agent that irrit the skin. you think it on fire. i have no doubt the children would becom hysterical. it not the kind of thing you never want to do again. thi wa the plan, the final solution. we wait 444 day for our hostag to come home from iran. we gave these peopl 51 days. i state on sever occas that there wa absolut noth in thi whole thing that the govern could point to as a success. well, fbi agent rick chang my mind. again a newclip from the hartford courant: \"and while express regret at the loss of life, he suggest that the oper had been at least a modifi success becaus not a singl feder shot had been fire and not a singl feder agent had been hurt.\" it took 17 dead children to get us that new definit of success. one more thought. the govern claim that they believ he had automat weapon on the premises. he had a licens for the 50 calib machin gun! they knew damn well he had one. they also knew he had it legally! still, without the element of surpris they sent in agent to get him. for all of thi my presid take full responsibility. what a guy! i hope he get it. in articl <exuptr.1431.0@exu.ericsson.se>, exuptr@exu.ericsson.s (patrick taylor, the sound board) writes: > in articl <11974@prijat.cs.uofs.edu> bill@triangle.cs.uofs.edu (bill gunshannon) writes: > >>befor you go absolv the batf & fbi of all blame in thi incident, you should >>probabl be awar of two import facts. >>1. there is no such thing as non-tox tear gas. tear ga is non-breath >> remain in it' presenc will caus nausea and vomiting, follow eventu >> by siezur and death. did the fbi know the physic health of all the peopl >> they exposed??

[ if ani of my protest inquisitor would *like* to turn the discuss to the author of tradition, i can accomod them :-), unlik *most* protestants, episcopalian admit claim from a) scriptur b) reason and c) tradit on roughli equal standing. ] earlier in john than my quot above, we read [john 13:34] \"i give you a new commandment: love one another.\" thi is the onli place in the nt where christian are given an explicit commandment, with the context comment on it imper mode pronounc by jesus. at the same meal [so we *readers* infer, sinc it is *not* in john, but in the synoptics] jesu says, \"take thi [bread]; thi is my body.\" [mark 14:22, cf. matthew 26:26, luke 22:19, 1 corinthian 11:24] the mode is imper (greek _labete_), and henc this, too, is a \"commandment.\" in *both* case we have to *infer* that the command is direct to a wider circl than the immedi colloc of discipl -- becaus we judg the evangelist' point in mention it (with the discipl by then mostli or entir dead) is that *we* are expect to follow thi as a command from our lord. in the case of communion, paul' mention (at least; thi is probabl true of the evangelist also) impli an ongo ritual liturgi in which these word oper to \"bind\" christian to the origin command to hi disciples, as a continu command to the christian community. i am entir comfort with thi inference, but i *must* point out that it is there, between us and the occas on which jesu spoke the command. i take it as a clear inference, at the veri least the evangelist' notion, that *all* christian are call to love one another, in jesus' command direct at the disciples. but i have to call attent to the inference. the command cannot appli to me without the gener from the specif context of it statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of christ. all read of scriptur ha to make such inferences, to get ani sens out of the text whatsoever. thi is a gener problem in read these text -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understand of our nativ languag in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreci of the origin context (and at points, the origin languages, when english mislead us.) i am go to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scriptur under control [ i don't *really* think thi is true, but it will suffic for my current purposes. ] i will address onli the issu that aris when we have alreadi cope with the understand of a 2000 year old text from anoth world than the one we live in. question at that level onli introduc more reser- vation about the command issu than will be found stipul that we can read the text as the origin audienc might have done. among the reason we have for see john' _agap allelou_ as a *general* command (not mere an instruct by jesu to thi discipl on that one occasion), and one link it to the synopt \"great commandment\" is that we have criticism, from jesus, about limit our love to those whom we congeni associ with. in matthew 5:43ff we read, \"you have learnt how it wa said: 'you must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. but i say to you: love your enemies.\" in fact, the leviticu context quot doe not say 'hate your enemy' -- it is mere the common human presumption. (and leviticu is at pain to say that the \"love\" should extend to stranger amongst the peopl of israel.) luke, in expand on thi same q context, goe on to have jesu say. \"even sinner love those who love them.\" [6:27] all of thi suggest [quit strongly, i'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the \"new commandment\" is not quit what jesu ha in mind. in short, infer *lead me* to gener the actual text to a command that is \"in force\" on christians, and with object not limit to other christians. trickier than the _agap allelou_ or institut of communion, there is the case of the \"great commission\" where (matthew 10, mark 6) the twelv are sent out to evangelize, \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.\" the verb is imper (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specif to the twelve, and there are further specifi (a in \"do not turn your step to pagan territory, and do not enter ani samaritan town\" -- the lukan parallel are even more specif to jesus' final journey to jerusalem) which make it harder to see thi gener to all christian than the previou examples. that hasn't prevent christian from make such an inference; what i have to call attent to is that such infer is not justifi in the text, nor (unlik the first two case i cite) by the rhetor of the evangelist urg on the reader. still, paul seem to have felt oblig to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\" even (contrari to jesus' instruct to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the end of the earth. so, christian after him have also taken thi as a \"commandment\" in the sens of john 14:15. do i \"accept\" this? i don't know. it is sure rather speculative. but you see how the rippl of infer spread out from the text that is the pretext -- christian (may) infer a gener commandment, applic to all, from what is present in the gospel as a specif occasion. i do not (necessarily) object to thi kind of gener -- but i *insist* that peopl who make it *must* have an understand that they are *reasoning* (at some consider length) from what we actual *have* in scripture. there are *assumptions* involv in thi reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselv scriptur (though peopl will do their best to \"justify\" their assumpt by other refer to scriptur -- which simpli add more infer into the mix!) let' move on to the \"great commandment\" -- that we should love god with our whole heart and mind and souls. thi is, perhaps, the synopt \"equivalent\" of john' _agap allelou_. and yet, it is not present as a commandment, in our texts. rather, the context is controversi with the pharisees. to cite matthew [22:34ff] \"but when the pharise heard that he had silenc the sadduce they got togeth and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, \"master, which is the greatest command of the law?\" it is by no mean obviou here (though i accept it as such) that jesus' answer is meant to be a command *to christians*. he is answer a polem from hi enemies. [ mark' account, in 12:28-34 cast the answer in a far more posit light as (so the \"scribe\" in thi version says) \"far more import than ani holocaust (i need to point out that thi word origin in the context of anim sacrifice; forget the nazi for this) or sacrifice.\" luke is intermedi -- he ha a lawyer pose the question \"to disconcert\" jesus, and get the good samarian parabl for hi pain [ luke 10:25-37 ]. the context here are so confusingli variou that one could be forgiven for draw *no* infer :-) in *no* account is thi said as if it were obvious to be taken as a command bind on christian -- though i think it an entir reason conclus in each case that jesu think it to be so. the point is that our mental gear have to grind a cycl or so to get to ani conclus from all of thi about what we are command to do, by jesus. and all of thi is conting on our understand the point of jesus' use of the torah in the (all quit different) gospel accounts, and the applic of such a context to *us*. the differ context among the synopt are curious. it should be note that onli in luke do we get the \"fixing\" of thi command by the parabl of the good samaritan. we may look for an analog *intent* in matthew, where 7:12 give the \"golden rule\" as \"the mean of the law and the prophets\" (and where we may also hear an echo of hillel say the same, a gener befor jesus.) if we make these associ (which i think are entir reasonable), we are -- again -- indulg in inference. the text do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the text as have thi kind of inter-relationship. current literari theori call thi \"intertextuality.\" my discuss of whi the _agap allelou_ \"has\" to appli beyond the commun of the disciples, and beyound the circl of christian believers, appli again here, to buttress a conclus that thi *is* (despit the present not say so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to christians. few christian would disagre with my conclus -- but i *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elabor chain of reason that are simpli not present in the texts, themselves. the contextu problem keep come up, more and more sever as we look at those say of jesu that are not so univers taken by christian as commandments. and we get some realli hard cases. take divorce. mark is pretti clear, \"the man who divorc hi wife and marri anoth is guilti of adulteri against her.\" [ 10:11, cf. luke 16:18 ] -- except that matthew ha an escap claus [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. thi seem to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take matthew' reservation); and some christians, to thi day, take it so. but some don't, at least in practice. thi is rather peculiar; it is not as if jesu were not explicit about thi (wherea he say noth at all about some of the thing peopl gnash their teeth over.) how is it possible, if the command of christ are clear, that matthew can so disagre with the other evangelist of the synopt tradition? i'm go to continu thi examination, into ever-murki waters, but thi is enough to start with. the theme is: \"find command in scriptur is an exercis in inference; our infer are inform by our assumptions, that is, our own cultur biases.\" i have, so far, identifi a veri few \"commandments\" that are gener accept by all christian -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulti start to surface. it is these difficulti i want to discuss in my next essay on thi topic. the divorc command alreadi strike at some of the difficulties: i see almost no evid that the peopl who are so eager to find command to condemn *me* with, spend ani time at all write nasti screed to soc.coupl or misc.leg about the horror or vicious of divorce, or demand that us law refus to allow it, or refus \"unrepent divorcees\" place in their churches. [ that is not to say that divorc *doesn't* enter into consider in gener -- it is most definit a matter of concern, in even the most \"liberal\" church circles. for example, a (wildly) liber episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liber diocese, ha recommend to a coupl who approach him to marri them that they have a \"private\" secular ceremoni befor a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremoni he celebr need not go through an agon \"examination\" by offici who would just as soon not take on thi role of interpret the command we are face with as christians. this, in a church that wa effect creat by a famou divorce! ] -- michael l. siemon i say \"you are gods, son of the mls@panix.com most high, all of you; nevertheless - or - you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com like ani prince.\" psalm 82:6-7 newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84136 from: mls@panix.com (michael siemon) subject: re: what part of \"no\" don't you understand?

who did koresh emulate? who wa koresh' teacher? koresh did to hi follow what satan did to eve. did not koresh kill hi followersr? did not satan caus adam and eve to die as well? did not the cult follow believ koresh even though they knew the real christ wa born in bethlehem? did not eve choos to eat from the tree of the knowledg of good and evil despit know that it would caus her death? god held them all responsible--deceiv and the rebeller. none of them had an excuse. as oppos to the branch davidians, we have a second chance. follow jesu and he will escort us to the path of etern life. don't follow jesus, and you stand condemn already, for like the branch davidian complex, your hous is alreadi on fire. satan, adam and eve have alreadi set it ablaze. it is just a slow burn, but it is burn nevertheless. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84143 from: an030@cleveland.freenet.edu (broward horne) subject: re: a messag for you mr. president: how do you know what happened?

annapoli may not be new york, but it' at least a two-hors town. but suppos 22,000 peopl is a \"small town\" -- it' still 22,000 peopl more than ezekiel predicted. and you'v said noth about the other problem. in chapter 26, ezekiel predict that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuables. however, nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre, and in chapter 29 ezekiel even quot god as say \"he and hi armi got no reward from the campaign he led against tyre.\" let' ignor alexand for a moment, and just pay attent to chapter 26. ezekiel say n. would destroy tyre, and n. did not destroy tyre. ezekiel say that n. would plunder their valuables, but n. did not plunder their valuables. regardless of what you think about tyre _now_, the fact is that n. die befor the place wa destroyed. ezekiel said n. wa go to do it, and n. did not. * thi post is, of course, pointless. inerrantist have an amaz abil to rewrit the bibl as need to fit whatev they want it to say. for example, i expect mr king to respond to the comment about ezekiel 26 by pull some \"clear implications\" out of hat. when ezekiel said that n. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearli impli that the wall would still be stand so peopl would know where the tower use to be. and when ezekiel said that n. would \"demolish your fine hous and throw your stones, timber and rubbl into the sea\", that clearli impli that n. would never set foot on the island. and when ezekiel wrote that n. would \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearli impli that n. would spend 13 year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the walls. see?

what is the sourc of thi pseudo-doctrine? who is > the pseudo-teacher? who is the great deceiver? ok, here' at least one christian' answer: jesu wa a jew, not a christian. in thi context matthew 5:14-19 make sense. matt 5:17 \"do not think that i [jesus] came to abolish the law or the prophets; i did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\" jesu live under the jewish law. however, he wa the culmin of the promis of the prophets. he came to *fulfill* the propheci and fulli obey god' purposes. vers 18 say \"for truli i say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished.\" the key to thi vers imho is the last phrase. jesus, as the fulfil of the law, \"accomplished\" what the law wa suppos to accomplish. vers 19: \"whoever then annul one of the least of these commandments, and so teach others, shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keep and teach them, he shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven.\" taken in the context of jesu teach jewish peopl about live live under the law, thi make sense. in general, it appear that jesu is respond to some critic he must have receiv about \"do away with the law.\" that wa not jesus' intent at all. he had come to earth to live the law as it should be live and fulfil the promis made by god to hi peopl all the way back to eve [gen 3:15-the serpent will bruis your heel, but *he* will bruis hi head.] jesu appear to be \"do away with the law\" becaus he did not honor the tradit of men as equal to the law of god. he regularli lock horn with the religi leader of the day becaus he would not conform to *their* rules, onli god' law. in the matthew passag jesu is defend hi dedic to the law and defend himself against hi accusors. almost the entir sermon on the mount (matt. 5-7) is dedic to help the jewish peopl understand the true intent of the law, sweep away the clutter which had been introduc by the pharase and their traditions. in galatian 3:23-26, paul describ the relationship of jesu to the law in thi way: [23] but befor faith came, we were kept in custodi under the law, be shut up to the faith which wa later to be revealed. [24] therefor the law ha becom our tutor to lead us to christ, that we may be justifi by faith. [25] but now that faith ha come, we are no longer under a tutor. [26] for you are all son of god through faith in christ jesus. i believ thi say that after christ wa revealed, the law had serv it' purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to christ,\" and now, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\" the law ha been \"fulfilled\" as christ said he would do. god, the author of the old law, and the christ/man, jesus, are the same personality. therefore, the old law and the new testament (the \"last will and testament\" of jesus) are base on the same moral principles. it make sens that mani of the principl in the old law are re-express in christianity. on the other hand, now that the law ha fulfil it' purpos and christian relat to god through christ, not the law, it also make sens that new practic and new symbol were establish to repres the \"mysteries\" of thi new relationship. i.e. baptism repres christ' death, burial, and resurrect (rom. 6:3-8), the lord' supper as a memori to hi sacrific (i cor. 11:26), and sunday as a day of worship commemor hi resurrect (matt 28:1ff, act 20:7) ok, that' one christian' explanation. i don't claim to have all these issu complet settl even in my own mind and i welcom other christian to offer other alternatives. pleas excus the long posting. thank for your interest if you have read thi far... john nunnal nunnally@acs.harding.edu newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84196 subject: re: alt.sex.stori under literari critic anali from: nunnally@acs.harding.edu (john nunnally) in <sandvik-170493170457@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com writes: > in articl <1qevbh$h7v@agate.berkeley.edu>, dzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu (denni > kriz) wrote: > > i'm go to tri to do someth here, that perhap mani would > > not have thought even possible. i want to begin the process of > > initi a literari critic studi of the pornographi post on > > alt.sex.stories, to identifi the major theme and motif present > > in the stori post there -- open up then the possibl of > > an object moral evalu of the materi present there. > > dennis, i'm astounded. i didn't know you were interest to even > studi such filth as alt.sex.stori provide... > > cheers, > kent > --- > sandvik@newton.apple.com. alink: ksand -- privat activ on the net. \"finally, brethern, whatev is true, whatev is honorable, whatev is right, whatev is pure, whatev is lovely, whatev is of good repute, if there is ani excel and if anyth worthi of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.\" phil. 4:8. more cheers, john nunnally@acs.harding.edu newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84197 from: royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (roy crabtree) subject: re: that kill by sword, must be kill by sword in articl <sandvik-210493014635@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes: >in articl <c5tcz8.4z9@rbdc.wsnc.org>, royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (roy crabtree) >wrote: >> in articl <20apr199306173611@utarlg.uta.edu> b645zaw@utarlg.uta.edu (stephen) writes: >> >in articl <sandvik-190493201048@sandvik-kent.apple.com>, >> >sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes... >> ... >> >>so are you happi now when 70+ people, includ innoc kids, >> >>di today?

it usual all ha to do with how the child is brought up. from the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the bible, the torah, the qur'an, & etc. he is told of thi wondrou god who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophet talk about in the scripture, of the miracl performed, & etc. he is also told that to question thi (a children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against god, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture' truth is to damn one' soul to hell. thus, by the time he is abl to read the scriptur for himself, the belief in it \"truth\" is so ingrain in hi mind it all seem a matter of course. but it doesn't stop there. onc the child is abl to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculc the child the \"right\" read of scripture, to concentr more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the wors ones, and to explain away the unexplain with \"mystery.\" circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" fact and \"truths,\" unreason belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of everi day. to doubt, of course, mean wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away hi brain when the matter concern god. all of thi ha some consider effect on the child, so that when he becom an adult, the superstit he' been taught are nearli imposs to remove. all of thi lead me to ask whether the theist can truli be object when question god, hell, heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. can he, for a moment, put asid thi notion that god *does* exist and look at everyth from a unbias point of view?

if christ himself wa not in heaven until sunday, how could the repent thief have been there with him? the answer lie in the locat of \"paradise\" when jesu died. appar paradis wa not exalt to heaven until easter day. jesu refer to it in the middl of the stori of the rich man and lazaru as \"abraham' bosom,\" to which the godli beggar lazaru wa carri by the angel after hi deceas (luke 16:19-31). thu \"abraham' bosom\" refer to the place where the soul of the redeem wait till the day of christ' resurrection. it wa not yet lift to heaven but it may well have been a section of hade (hebrew: sheol), reserv for believ who had die in the faith but would not be admit into the gloriou presenc of god in heaven until the price of redempt had actual been paid on calvary; or even that none would preced the presenc of jesu back to glori with the father. doubtless it wa the infern paradis that the soul of jesu and the repent thief repair after they each die on friday afternoon. but on sunday, after the risen christ had first appear to mari magdalen (john 20:17) and her two companion (matthew 28:9), presum he then took up with him to glori all the inhabit of infern paradis (includ abraham, lazarus, and the repent thief). we read in ephesian 4:8 concern christ: \"ascend on high, he led captiv captive; he gave gift unto men.\" vers 9 continues: \"but what doe `he ascended' mean but that he also descend to the lowest part of the earth?\" -i.e., to hades. vers 10 adds: \"he who descend is the same as he who ascend abov all the heavens.\" presum he led the whole band of liber captiv from hade (i.e., the whole popul of preresurrect paradise) up to the glori of heaven. ra> whenev your person interpret of biblic passag is ra> challenged, your onli respons seem to be that one need mere to ra> \"look at the bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see biblic thing differ from you?

(promis messiah, p. 100) notic that mcconki said the christian are as wrong about their \"three-in-on god\" and their belief that \"god is a spirit\" as they are in their understand of who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are. befor examin mcconkie' attack and it validity, we shall read a few more statement by mcconki and other mormon sourc concern the word \"elohim\" and \"jehovah.\" mcconki stated: \"...the chief design of christ that ha been preserv for us in the old testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the exalt name-titl jehovah. (promis messiah, p. 367) \"_elohim_, plural word though it is, is also use as the exalt name-titl of god the etern father, a usag that connot hi supremaci and omnipotence, he be god abov all gods. (mormon doctrine, p. 224) agre with mcconki on the question of who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are, the apostl jame e. talmag stated: \"_elohim_, as understood and use in the restor church of jesu christ, is the name-titl of god the etern father, whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_ -- the onli begotten in the flesh, jesu christ. (jesu the christ, p. 38) \"a doctrin exposit by the first presid and the twelve\" apostl of the mormon church state that \"god the etern father...[is] designate[d] by the exalt name-titl 'elohim'...\" (articl of faith, p. 466) \"...christ in hi preexistent, antemortal, or unembodi state...wa known as jehovah...\" (articl of faith, p. 471) today mormon leader teach that \"elohim\" in the ot refer to god the father and \"jehovah\" refer to christ. mcconki attack christian for say \"jehovah\" can refer to the father. he stress that these two \"name-titles\" should not be chang around so that christ is call \"elohim\" and the father is call \"jehovah.\" \"...the father...i elohim, not jehovah.... jehovah is christ, and christ is jehovah; they are one and the same person.\" (promis messiah, p. 111) in the ot of the kjv of the bible, the hebrew word \"elohim\" is use to refer to the true god, fals god and goddesses, and the judg of israel. when refer to the true god, \"elohim\" is translat with a capit \"g.\" when refer to fals god and goddess and the judg of israel, it is translat with a small \"g.\" it is translat four time as \"judges\" (exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), onc as \"judge\" (1 sam. 2:25), twice as \"mighty\" (gen. 23:6; exod. 9:28), onc as \"angels\" (ps. 8:5), onc as \"godly\" (mal. 2:15), onc as \"great\" (gen. 30:8), and onc as \"veri great.\" (1 sam. 14:15) the word \"jehovah\" is the tradit pronunci of the tetragramm yhwh or yhvh with the vowel point taken from the word \"adonai.\" mani peopl believ the true pronunci of the tetragramm wa yahweh or yahveh. however, sinc \"jehovah\" rather than yahweh is the word use by mormonism, thi section will also use \"jehovah\" instead of yahweh to examin the valid of the claim of mormon leader regard that name. \"jehovah,\" unlik \"elohim,\" is never use of fals gods. it is the person name of the triun god of the bible. in the kjv, \"jehovah\" is render primarili \"lord,\" sometim \"god,\" and rare \"lord.\" now that we understand someth about the word \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" and their use by mormon leaders, we shall consid the apostl mcconkie' attack on christian for believ the father is \"jehovah.\" in tri to prove that \"jehovah\" refer exclus to christ, mcconki cite sever vers from the bible. some of these vers and mcconkie' interpret of them will be examin to see whether he wa right. remember, mcconki said the father is not \"jehovah;\" he is onli \"elohim.\" the first exampl we shall consid involv mcconkie' interpret of ps. 110:1. of thi vers he stated: \"of whom spake david when hi tongu wa touch by the holi spirit and he testified, \"the lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemi thi footstool?\" (ps. 110:1.) two lord are here involved: one is speak to the other; one is greater than the other; one is make provis for the triumph and glori of the other. who are they and what messag is contain in thi messian prophecy? \"what think ye of christ?\" our lord ask certain of hi detractor toward the end of hi mortal ministry. \"whose son is he?\" is christ the son of god or of someon else? is he to be born of a divin parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? that he wa to be a descend of david wa a matter of great pride to all the jews. and so they answered, \"the son of david.\" david' son? truli he was. but he wa more, much more. and so our lord, with irrefut logic and to their complet discomfiture, asked, \"how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemi thi footstool? if david then call him lord, how is he hi son?\" that is, if he is onli the son of david, how is it that the great king, act under inspiration, call him lord and worship him as such? and we might add: _who is the other lord, the one who spake unto david' lord?_ can there be ani question as to how jesu is interpret the word of the psalm? he is say that it means: '_the father said unto the son, elohim said unto jehovah_, sit thou on my right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then i will rais you up to etern glori and exalt with me, where you will continu to sit on my right hand forever.' (promis messiah, pp. 101-102) (emphasi added) agre with the abov statement by mcconkie, the follow remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormon think of christ, p. 6 reads: \"the lord [elohim, the father] said unto my lord [jehovah, the son]...\" (bracket in original) mcconki clearli state that it is \"elohim\" the father who is speak to \"jehovah\" the son in thi psalm. however, when one look at the hebrew word translat \"lord,\" it becom appar that either the first \"lord\" is not the father or els the father is \"jehovah.\" either way mcconki is wrong. the psalm reads: \"the lord [jehovah] said unto my lord [adon], sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemi thi footstool. (ps. 110:1) the first \"lord\" in thi vers is \"jehovah\" who mormon say is christ, not the father. the second \"lord\" is the hebrew word \"adon\" (singular for \"adonai,\" mean master or lord). if the first \"lord\" is the father and the second \"lord\" is the son, then the father is \"jehovah\" and the son is \"adon.\" however, if the father is not \"jehovah\" as mcconki claimed, then the first \"lord\" is \"jehovah\" the son, but who, then, is \"adon?\" obvious the father is \"jehovah\" in thi psalm, and hi son is \"adon.\" anoth exampl involv isa. 42:6 about which mcconki state the following: \"i the lord have call thee in righteousness,\" _isaiah quot the father as say of christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a coven of the people, for a light of the gentiles.\" (isa. 42:6.) (promis messiah, p. 81) (emphasi added) mcconki said the father wa speak of christ in thi passag which reads: \"i the lord [jehovah] have call thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a coven of the people, for a light of the gentiles. (isa. 42:6) accord to mcconkie, \"i the lord\" refer to the father, and \"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to christ. however, the \"lord\" who is speak is \"jehovah\" which mean either mcconki wa wrong about who is speak or els the father is \"jehovah.\" anoth exampl involv ps. 22:7-8. of these vers mcconki stated: \"the same psalm says: \"all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trust on the lord that he would deliv him: let him deliv him, see he delight in him.\" (ps. 22:7-8.) _the fulfillment, as jesu hung on the cross_, is found in these words: \"the chief priest mock him, with the scribe and elders, said, he save others; himself he cannot save. if he be the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believ him. he trust in god; let him deliv him now, if he will have him: for he said, i am the son of god. the thiev also, which were crucifi with him, cast the same in hi teeth.\" (matt. 27:41-44.) (promis messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasi added) ps. 22:7-8 read as follows: \"all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trust on the lord [jehovah] that he would deliv him: let him deliv him, see he delight in him. mcconki said these vers had their fulfil \"a jesu hung on the cross.\" that mean the person who wa scorn in these vers wa christ. who, then, wa the \"lord\" in whom he trusted? it wa \"jehovah\" the father. anoth exampl involv ps. 31:13 and ps. 41:9. regard them, mcconki state the following: \"with refer to the conniv and conspir plot incid to our lord' arrest and judici trial the propheci was: \"they took counsel togeth against me, they devis to take away my life.\" (ps. 31:13.) as to the role of juda in those conspiracies, the psalmist says: \"mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up hi heel against me.\" (ps. 41:9.) (promis messiah, p. 532) apostl mcconki said these psalm refer to christ' \"arrest and judici trials.\" we shall first consid ps. 31 and then ps. 41. while mcconki onli quot vers 13 of ps. 31, vers 14 will also be includ to give a complet understand of the matter. \"for i have heard the slander of many: fear wa on everi side: while they took counsel togeth against me, they devis to take away my life. but i trust in thee, o lord [jehovah]: i said, thou art my god [elohim]. (ps. 31:13-14) mcconki said vers 13 refer to jesu christ. vers 14 goe on to tell that he (christ) trust in the \"lord\" who is call hi \"god\" or \"elohim.\" mormon teach that the god abov jesu is \"elohim\" the father. vers 14, however, reveal that the \"elohim\" of the man jesu is \"jehovah\" the father. in ps. 41, mcconki onli quot one verse; however, two vers will be consid in thi examination. \"yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up hi heel against me. but thou, o lord [jehovah], be merci unto me, and rais me up, that i may requit them. (ps. 41:9-10) mcconki state abov that vers 9 refer to judas' role in christ' death. sinc it wa juda who wa the \"familiar friend\" who \"lift up hi heel,\" the pronoun \"mine,\" \"i,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in vers 9 must refer to christ. notic that at the begin of vers 10 there is a chang of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refer to the \"lord\" (jehovah). then the pronoun \"me\" and \"i\" which refer to christ are use again. that mean christ wa speak to \"jehovah\" the father in these verses. anoth exampl involv mcconkie' follow remark about ps. 110:4. \"one of the great messian prophecies, spoken by the mouth of david, says: \"the lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek.\" (ps. 110:4.) (promis messiah, p. 450) mcconki admit thi is a messian propheci involv christ. the question is, what in thi vers refer to christ? \"the lord [jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. (ps. 110:4) doe the \"lord,\" which is \"jehovah,\" refer to christ? if mcconki is right and jesu is \"jehovah,\" but the father is not, then the \"lord\" would have to refer to christ. but who, then, is the one address as the \"priest forev after the order of melchizedek?\" the bibl reveal that the one refer to is jesu christ (heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the \"lord\" (jehovah) in ps. 110:4 is the father. anoth exampl involv isa. 53:4-12. of these vers mcconki stated: \"of the aton sacrific of the futur messiah, isaiah said... the _lord_ ha laid on him the iniqu of us all.... it pleas the _lord_ to bruis him... (promis messiah, p. 234) (emphasi added) mcconki rightli said these vers refer to \"the aton sacrific of the futur messiah.\" however, what he fail to mention is that they also prove that the father is \"jehovah.\" vers 6 reads: \"all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turn everi one to hi own way; and the lord [jehovah] hath laid on him [christ] the iniqu of us all,\" and vers 10 reads: \"yet it pleas the lord [jehovah] to bruis him [christ]...\" obvious the \"lord\" who laid on christ \"the iniqu of us all\" and who bruis him is god the father who is call \"jehovah\" in these verses. remember, mcconki state that \"some sectarian even believ that jehovah is the suprem deity,\" and that christ \"came into mortality\" as hi \"onli begotten\" son. he call thi concept \"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" to prove that it is mcconki who is misinform and believ untruth, two scriptur refer (2 sam. 7:14; ps. 2:7) will be examined. mcconki state the follow regard these scriptures: \"in the midst of a passag that is clearli messianic, the lord say of the seed of david: \"i will be hi father, and he shall be my son.\" (2 sam. 7:14.) in the second psalm, the whole of which is also clearli messianic, occur thi statement: \"thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee.\" (ps. 2:7.) paul quot both of these statement in hebrew 1:5 and say they are propheci that christ would come as the son of god. (promis messiah, p. 143) mcconki cite heb. 1:5 to show that 2 sam. 7:14 and ps. 2:7 refer to christ who \"would come as the son of god.\" sinc mcconki first referenc 2 sam. 7:14, thi examin will, too. however, along with vers 14, vers 11-13 will also be included. \"and as sinc the time that i command judg to be over my peopl israel, and have caus thee to rest from all thine enemies. also the lord [jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house. and when thi day be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thi fathers, i will set up thi seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thi bowels, and i will establish hi kingdom. he shall build an hous for my name, and i will stablish the throne of hi kingdom for ever. i will be hi father, and he shall be my son. (2 sam. 7:11-14) these vers teach that the \"lord\" (jehovah) would have a son, the messiah. in the second exampl mcconki cite ps. 2:7. thi examin will includ vers 8. notic that it is the \"lord\" (jehovah) who says, \"thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee.\" \"i will declar the decree: the lord [jehovah] hath said unto me, thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee. ask of me, and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost part of the earth for thi possession. mcconki said these vers of scriptur are \"clearli messianic,\" and he acknowledg they teach that \"christ would come as the son of god.\" what he is not will to acknowledge, however, is that these scriptur also teach that the father is \"jehovah\" and that the \"sectarians\" who believ \"jehovah is the suprem deiti whose son\" is jesu christ, \"the onli begotten,\" are right in their belief. anoth exampl involv mic. 5:4. of thi vers mcconki state the following: \"and so, truly, did our lord act _dure hi mortal ministry! truly, thi is he of whom it is written_: \"he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord, in the majesti of the name of the lord hi god... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth.\" (mic. 5:4.) (promis messiah, p. 182) (emphasi added) accord to mcconkie, the pronoun \"he\" at the begin of mic. 5:4 refer to christ \"dure hi mortal ministry.\" who, then, is the \"lord hi god?\" mic. 5:4 reads: \"and he [christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord [jehovah], in the majesti of the name of the lord [jehovah] hi god [elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth. obvious the \"lord\" of jesu christ is \"jehovah\" the father who is refer to as \"jehovah hi elohim.\" anoth exampl involv ps. 2:2 and isa. 61:1. of these vers mcconki state the following: \"a number of messian passag speak of \"the lord, and...hi anointed\" (ps. 2:2), signifi that the chosen one wa consecr and set apart for the ministri and mission that wa his. _jesu appli these passag to himself_ by quot isaiah' prophecy. \"the lord hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek\" (isa. 61:1), and then saying: \"thi day is thi scriptur fulfil in your ears\" (luke 4:21). (promis messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasi added) the first sourc mcconki quot -- ps. 2:2 -- read as follows: \"the king of the earth set themselves, and the ruler take counsel together, against the lord [jehovah], and against hi anointed. mcconki said the \"anointed\" one wa christ. if that is true, who wa \"jehovah?\" if \"jehovah\" is alway christ, who wa the \"anointed\" one? obvious \"jehovah\" is refer to god the father and the \"anointed\" is inde refer to christ. the second sourc mcconki cite is isa. 61:1 which states: \"the spirit of the lord [adonai] god [jehovah] is upon me; becaus the lord [jehovah] hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberti to the captives, and the open of the prison to them that are bound; the one who wa anoint to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open wa jesu christ. who, then, wa the one who anoint him? thi vers say the \"lord\" (jehovah) did the anointing. again, we face the same problem. if \"jehovah\" doe not refer to the father, but onli to christ, then jesu anoint someone, but who? as mcconki point out, \"jesu appli these passag to himself.\" therefore, the \"jehovah\" who anoint christ is god the father. other exampl could be cite to show that mcconki and other mormon leader are wrong when they say god the father is not \"jehovah.\" however, these should be enough to expos their error. now, what about mormonism' claim that jesu is \"jehovah,\" but he is not \"elohim?\" it is true that jesu is \"jehovah.\" the follow scriptur prove thi fact: \"thu saith the lord [jehovah] the king of israel, and hi redeem the lord [jehovah] of hosts; i am the first, and i am the last; and besid me there is no god. (isa. 44:6) [jesu said] ...i am the first and the last: i am he that liveth, and wa dead...

(josh. 24:15-16) these vers teach that the onli true, live \"elohim\" in heaven and on earth is \"jehovah\" -- the triun god who made heaven and earth and all therein. \"jehovah\" is greater than ani \"elohim,\" becaus all other \"elohim\" are idols. the realiti behind them is demonic. (deut. 32:17) \"jehovah elohim\" ha given explicit warn and guidelin regard these fals \"elohim.\" he told hi peopl not to have ani \"elohim\" but him. he told the peopl that if they left him for the fals \"elohim,\" those \"elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. he warn the peopl to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be not deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swear by, and make coven with fals \"elohim.\" \"jehovah elohim\" told hi peopl he would eventu judg all fals \"elohim\" and their followers. despit these warn and guidelines, \"elohim's\" coven peopl forsook him and believ in and worship the fals \"elohim's\" of the peopl they came in contact with. ju. 10:6 state that \"the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord [jehovah] and serv baalim, and ashtaroth, and the god [elohim] of syria, and the god [elohim] of zidon, and the god [elohim] of moab, and the god [elohim] of the children of ammon, and the god [elohim] of the philistines, and forsook the lord [jehovah], and serv not him.\" thi examin ha shown that the \"elohim\" of mormonism, like the \"elohim\" in ju. 10:6 is not the true \"jehovah elohim.\" therefore, the peopl who leav the true \"elohim\" for the mormon \"elohim\" will do \"evil...in the sight of the lord [jehovah].\" although mcconki attack christian for their belief in a triun god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father [jehovah] sent hi son into the world, these belief are true. god is triune; he is spirit; he is \"jehovah;\" and he did send hi son into the world to redeem mankind. it is obviou from thi examin that it is not the christian who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are. one wonder what \"holi writ\" mcconki had in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that \"elohim is the father, and that jehovah is the son.\" he certainli did not mean the bibl which teach that the father, son, and holi spirit are all the one \"jehovah elohim.\" he appar did not mean the d&c either, becaus chapter 109, vers 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the father as \"jehovah.\" summari obvious joseph field smith' statement that the mormon \"have a clear and perfect understand of the natur of god\" (doctrin of salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. the mormon god are not the true god as mormon claims, but are idol which caus their follow to commit adulteri against god and idolatry. in answer to jesus' question, \"but whom say ye that i am,\" mormon say jesu is someon differ from the jesu who is reveal in the bibl and whom the apostl preached. therefore, anyon trust in the mormon jesu is believ in \"anoth jesus\" whom paul warn about. bernard p. brockbank, of the first quorum of the seventy, admit in the may 1977 issu of the ensign, a mormon publication, that the mormon jesu is differ from the christian jesus. he state that \"it is true that mani of the christian church worship a differ jesu christ than is worship by the mormon or the church of jesu christ of latter-day saints.\" (p. 26) the peopl who believ in the mormon jesu are commit adulteri against god and idolatry. they do not have the son; therefore, they do not have the father, and they do not have etern life. as the apostl bruce r. mcconki rightli stated: \"salvat come onli by worship the true god.\" (promis messiah, p. 163) mcconki also rightli state that \"the mere worship of a god who ha the proper scriptur name doe not assur one that he is worship the true and live god,\" becaus the \"true name of deity\" can be appli to \"fals concept of god.\" (mormon doctrine, p. 270) rememb that the apostl stephen l. richard admit that joseph smith, jr., gave \"a new concept of god and the godhead.\" (contribut of joseph smith, p. 1) it is import for the peopl who have left the true triun god reveal in the bibl to repent and return to him. they must forsak the sin of idolatri and adulteri which they are commit in mormonism. the bibl says: \"...all that forsak thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, becaus they have forsaken the lord [jehovah], the fountain of live waters.

well, the best thing to do is to read the book \"parallel universes\" by dr. fred wolf. in essence, dr. wolf say that one interpret of the sub-atom particle/wav dualiti is that what we perceiv as a wave is actual an infin number of parallel univers overlaid, and in each of these univers there is a particl in a differ location. when we do someth to make a particl \"appear,\" we are actual caus all the parallel univers to collaps into one. appar thi is one line of thought on the natur of qm, that is go through some of the scientif community. dr. wolf (and mani others) claim that somehow the collaps is caus by the mental effort of observ the particle. thi impli that mind is more than mere a biolog phenomenon. he then extrapol that if mind is an integr part of the universe, then perhap conscious is the element that give order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s). it all get rather interesting, but what i find facin is that thi would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practic in my religion. dr. wolf specul that the order function of mind could be caus by the select of a futur from an infinit number of possibl futures; he say that thi might be done by some sort of commun between one current, and possibl futur selves. i have long specul that if magick is not mere a form of self delus then perhap it could be caus by some sort of a select of one of mani possibl futures. i realiz that thi get pretti bizarre, but it never hurt to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as anoth possibil explain of the world in which we find ourselves. after all, the more we learn about the univers in which we live, the more we learn that it is truli a veri strang place. >nanci eric newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84312 from: emarsh@hernes-sun.eng.sun.com (eric marsh) subject: re: after 2000 years, can we say that christian moral is in articl <1r66su$dm7@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@d012s658.uucp (frank o'dwyer) writes: >in articl <sandvik-210493213823@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes: >#frank, unless you didn't realiz it, you are just now involv >#in a debat where we have variou opinions, and each entiti >#ha it own frame where the opinion is expressed. i think i >#don't need to state the dread r-word. >so, it' _sometimes_ correct to say that moral is objective, or what?

[however, the major of the book is in hellenist arama (not babylonian aramaic) and onli ha kethuvim or write status.] ref: encyclopedia of religion, mircea eliade: daniel, or, in hebrew, daniyye'l; hero of the biblic book that bear hi name. daniel is present as a jew in the babylonian exil who achiev notorieti in the royal court for hi dream interpret and cryptographi and for hi salvat from death in a lion' pit. he also appear in the last chapter of the book as the reveal of divin mysteri and of the timet of israel' restor to national-religi autonomy. as a practition of oneirom in the court, describ in daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), daniel per- form hi interpret alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decod hi vision and mysteri of the future. it is like that the name daniel is pseudonymous, a deliber allus to a wise and righteou man known from ugarit legend and earlier biblic tradition. (ez. 14:4,28:3). the authorship of the book is complic not onli by the divers narr voic and content but by it language: daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in hebrew, wherea daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in aramaic. the languag divis parallel the subject divis (daniel 1-6 concern legend and dream interpretations; 7-12 concern apocalypt vision and interpret of older prophecies). the overal chronolog scheme as well as intern themat balanc (daniel 2-7 is chiliast related) suggest an attempt at redact unity. after the prefatori tale emphas the life in court and the loyalti of daniel and some youth to their ancestr religion, a chronolog order is discernable: a sequenc from king nebuchadrezzar to dariu is report (dn. 7-12). much of thi royal date and even some of the tale are problematic: for example, daniel 4 speak of nebuchadrezzar' transform into a beast, a stori that is report in the qumran scroll of nabonidus; belshazzar is portray as the last king of babylon, although he wa never king; and dariu is call a mede who conquer babylon and is place befor cyru ii of persia, although no such dariu is known (the mede follow the persians, and dariu is the name of sever persian kings). presum the episod of daniel 2-6, depict a seri of monarch reversals, episod of ritual observances, and report of miracul deliver were collect in the seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second centuri bce) in order to reinvigor wane jewish hope in divin provid and encourag steadfast faith. the vision of daniel 7-12, report event from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyru ii (but actual predict the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine), were collect and publish dure the reign of antiochu iv prior to the maccabean revolt, for it wa then (begin in 168 bce) that the jew were put to the test concern their allegi to judaism and their ancestr traditions, and mani refus to desecr the statu of mose and endur a martyr' death for their resolut trust in divin dominion. all of the vision of daniel dramat thi dominion in differ ways: for example, via imag of the enthron of a god of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invest with rule (thi figur wa interpret by jew as michael the archangel and by christian as christ), in chapter 7; via zodiac imag of cosmic beast with bizarr manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpret of ancient prophecies, especi those of jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in daniel 9-12. the imageri of the four beast in chapter 7 (parallel by the imag of four metal in chapter 2), repres four kingdom to be overthrown by a fifth monarchi of divin origin, is one of the endur imag of the book; it sur- vive as a prototyp of jewish and christian histor and apocalypt scheme to the end of the middl ages. the role and power of thi imageri in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuri work of the exeget isaac abravanel, the scientist isaac newton, and the philosoph jean bodin and among the fifth monarchi men of seventeenth centuri england, for example, is abid testimoni to the use of thi ancient topo in organ the chiliast imagin of divers thinker and groups. the schema is still use to thi day by variou group predict the apocalypt advent. the encourag in the face of religi persecut that is found and propagand in daniel 11-12 contain a remark reinterpret of isaiah 52:13-53:12, regard the suffer servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful. neither the open stori about daniel and the youth nor the final martyrolog allus advoc violenc or revolt; they rather advoc a stanc of piety, civil disobedience, and trust resignation. victori for the faith is in the hand of the archangel michael, and the martyr will be resurrect and grant astral immortality. persum the circl behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighter and may reflect some proto-pharisa group of hasidim, or pietists. the theme of resist to oppression, freedom of worship, preserv of monotheist integrity, the overthrow of histor dominions, and the acknowledg of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have serv as a token of trust for the faith in their darkest hour. zarathushtra, founder of the religion know as zoroastrian or mazdaism (from mazda or ahura mazda, the name of the god prophesi by zarathushtra.) the etymolog and histori of zarathushtra, the avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in variou iranian languag and in relat form else- where. there may have been an old persian form, zara-ushtra, from which the greek form, zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have exist an old iranian form, zarat-ushtra, to which may be link the middl iranian zrdrwsht, sever middl persian form (such as zrtwsht), and the new persian zardusht. we can state with certainti onli that the second half of the name, ushtra, mean \"camel.\" the form zoroaster, deriv from the greek zoroastres, wa use tradit in european cultur until the eighteenth century, when zarathustra, closer to the origin (and as found in nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscoveri of the avesta, the collect of sacr book of zoroastrianism, and the result studi in iranian philology. [see avesta.] notwithstand the great and continu popular of zarathushtra, even in western culture, the sourc avail to us are few, extrem fragmented, and heterogeneous. our principl sourc are the five gatha (\"songs\"), attribut to zarathushtra himself and includ in the yasna section of the avesta: gatha ahunava (yasna 28-34), gatha ushtava (yasna 43-46), gatha spentamainyu (yasna 47-50), gatha vokukhshathra (yasna 51), and gatha vashishtoishti (yasna 53), the last of which wa probabl written after the prophet' death. other sourc of considerable, albeit varying, import are the younger avesta and the remain zoroastrian religi literature, in particular the pahlavi text of the ninth and tenth centur ce. although the achaemenid inscript (sixth to fourth centur bce) never mention zarathushtra, he is mention by some greek sourc of the time (not, however, by herodotus, who seem unawar of him). the avesta doe not provid ani direct or explicit data concern the true chronolog histori of zarathushtra. but the text is use in an indirect way, as it clearli impli that the environ in which zoroastrian aros wa not that of iran under the mede or the persians. the greek sources, on the other hand, do provid some inform concern the time of zarathushtra, although from a histor point of view they are unreliable. some place him six thousand year befor the trojan war (xanthu of lydia, eudoxu of cnidus, hermippus, hermodorus, aristotle, plutarch, diogen laertius, and pliny). the account by xanthu of lydia, however, ha also been interpret by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, year befor the expedit of xerx against greece. thi interpret is favor by diogen laertius, who make refer to xanthus, but although a few scholar (a. s. shabazi, helmut humbach) have recent attempt to rehabilit it under variou pretexts, it is gener rejected. although the histor valu of the greek sourc is negligible, they are nonetheless import in that they show that the millenarian doctrin of histori of the cosmo had alreadi been develop in iran by the achaemenid period, as the abov account would seem to demonstrate. they also show that by thi time zarathushtra wa alreadi seen as an almost mythic figure, one from an extrem distant past. all of thi lead to the conclus that the prophet could not have belong to a histor period contemporari with, or even close to, that of the achaemenids. later zoroastrian sources, the pahlavi texts, do provid an absolut chrono- logi for zarathushtra, one that wa also accept by some arab authors. accord- ing to these sources, zarathushtra live 300 or 258 year befor alexander. again, scholar are divid on the valid of the chronology; some view it as histor reliabl while other believ that it is devoid of histor justification. the most convinc arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. the figur of 258 year is accur onli on the surfac becaus it represents, in fact, the more gener one of 300, which wa employ by sasanid propagandist to locat zarathushtra' lifetim roughli around the begin of iranian domination. for a number of reason connect with complex problem inher in the iranian chronology, there wa also a desir on the part of the sasanid propagandist to avoid ani millenarian threat. in thi context, zarathushtra, whom tradit place earli in the ninth millennium after the begin of the cosmos, convert vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and vishtaspa' convers wa view by some as the begin of the millennium (thu explain the doubl date of 300 and 258 year befor alexander). given the unreli of the few avail sources, we are forc to reconstruct an absolut chronolog on the basi of other elements, princip on the content that zarathushtra must have live a few centuri befor cyru the great, cambyses, and darius, as there is no mention in the avesta of the great polit achiev that took place in western iran in the middl of the first millennium bce. nor is there ani mention of the histori of that period, which wa to lead iran to a posit of such predominance. at the same time, for a number of reasons, go back much further in histori would not be justified. consequently, the tradit accept theori of place zara- thushtra around the begin of the first millennium bce appear to be the most legitimate. as to zarathushtra' land of origin, mani scholar agree, on the basi of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern iran. some have held that he wa a mede, larg becaus of a late iranian tradit link zarathushtra with azerbaijan, but also becaus of linguist reasons, base on the languag of the avesta. thi hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on histor and linguist grounds, that zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precis from which region. there is a consider varieti of opinion on thi particular matter, includ the improb view that he came from chorasmia, or present-day khorezm, or from a wider chorasmian region, reach as far as the oas of merv and herat. most likely, however, zarathushtra' land of origin is somewher in the vast area stretch from the hindu kush mountain rang to the more southern region of bactria and arachosia (modern qandahar), as well as drangiana (the area of lake helmand). it would thu be locat in what is now afghanistan or in the border region of iran. zarathushtra himself tell us that he belong to the priestli cast (yasna 33.6). he wa a zaotar (cf. sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belong to a specif group connect with a school that produc veri elabor and learn religi poetry. even in the so-cal younger avesta he is describ as an athravan (yasht 13.94), a more gener term encompass the entir priestli caste. to enter it he had undergon a long and rigid training, which he use to lend digniti (a in the gathas) to the content of hi new message, the product of a great and origin ethic mind. zarathushtra also belong to that vener priestli tradition, link india to iran in anoth way, by center hi teach on the prais of the ashavan, or \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the vedic rtavan, seek truth and master it, thu becom ashavan in thi life - almost an initi - and bless after death. ani good follow of such teach seek the \"vision of asha,\" just as those chose the right path in vedic india aspir to the \"vision of the sun,\" a manifest of rta. behind these concept and thi languag lie the great tradit of \"aryan mysticism,\" that is, of indo-iranian mysticism. zarathushtra' greatness, however, doe not lie in hi have belong to a particular religi tradition. rather, it lie in the innov and strength of hi message, which wa in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fulli and effect introduc two great revolutionari ideas: dualist monoth (the wise lord who father two twin spirits, the benefic and the evil); and the expect of a transfigur (av., frashokereti; pahl., frashgird) of life and existence. [see frashokereti] both hi monotheist and dualist idea and hi particular soteriolog doctrin deepli separ zarathushtra' teach from the indo-iranian tradi- tion of hi upbringing. they exemplifi hi rebellion against a formalist and ritualist religion that did not provid adequ answer to the problem of evil. becaus of hi basic tenets, zarathushtra, who advoc an inward religios and the right of the individu to resist the imper of tradi- tion, can be number among the greatest of religi figures. anoth origin facet of zarathushtra' message, one that is not easi to understand but which, however, hold the key to a deeper understand of the complex intellectu and poetic structur of the gathas, is the doctrin of the amesha spentas, the \"benefic immortals.\" these are spiritu of the abstract notion of good thought, best truth, desir power, bounteou devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which oper accord to a system of interrel and correl and can simultan be the manifest of a divin and of human virtue. [see amesha spentas.] other than the name of hi father, pourushaspa (\"possess gray horses\"), and of hi mother, dughdova (\"one who ha milked\"), we know almost noth of zarathushtra' life. a late pahlavi text also give the name of four brothers. accord to tradition, zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirti he wa subject to a revelation, both through an intens and power inspir and through a vision. onli after ten year had passed, however, did he succeed in convert a cousin of his, maidhyoimah, to hi beliefs. he wa strongli oppos in hi nativ land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestli group associ with tradit teach and practices. thi hostil caus him to leav hi region (yasna 46:1) and to seek refug at the court of kavi vishtaspa, a ruler who had been convert to the new religion togeth with hi wife, hutaosa, when the prophet, accord to tradition, wa forty-two year old. we also know the name of a son, isat vastra (\"desir pastures\"), and of three daughter born of hi first wife, as well as the name of two more sons, urvatatnara (\"command men\") and hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of hi second wife, hvovi, a member of the influenti hvogva (\"possess good cattle\") family. two other figur belong to the hvogva famili are mentioned: frashaoshtra and jamaspa, the former as hvovi' father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, pouruchista (\"veri thoughtful\"), whose wed is celebr in the fifth hymm in the gatha (yasna 53). again, accord to tradition, zarathushtra die at the age of seventy-seven. he wa assassin by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belong to the tuirya tribe and wa call tur i bradr (hi name is known onli in the pahlavi form). the pauciti of inform on the prophet' life is compens by a tradi- tion, rich in legendari detail, that aros through the centuri in zoroastrian communities. the main text document the tradit are the seventh book of the denkard, a pahlavi work date from the ninth centuri ce, as well as passag from other pahlavi text and a new persian work from the thirteenth century, the zarathusht-nama (book of zarathushtra), written by zaratusht-i bahram-i pazhdu. mythic and ritual element prevail in the later legend about zarathushtra, which ideal him into a symbol and make him the archetyp of the perfect man. zarathushtra' great popular in the ancient world continu throughout the renaiss until the enlightenment. dure the classic and hellenist period he wa view as a wise man, a typic repres of an \"alien wisdom,\" a master of the secret of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. pythagorean thinker went so far as to see the influenc of zarathushtra on pythagora himself, and the academician alway openli admir the persian thinker who found the school of the magi and advoc a doctrin of dualism. earliest christian view zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith, one who not onli prophesied, as had the biblic prophets, the advent of the messiah but also predict the supernatur sign of hi coming, the star that wa to appear in the east and guid the three magi to the manger in bethlehem. [see magi.] thi christian interpret is deriv from the zoroastrian doctrin of the saoshyant, the savior of the future. [see saoshyant.] later, however, religi struggl aros dure the sasanid empir in persia (third to seventh centuri ce), which link the spread of christian with the roman empire. zarathushtra' popular in the christian world began to decline. the iranian prophet, who had been prais often by the gnostic school and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messeng from the past, wa now seen, instead, as a leader of impostur and heresy, a teacher of the diabol art of witchery. but dure the renaiss- anc and the enlightenment, european cultur revert to the imag of zara- thushtra that had come down through classic and hellenist antiquity. he wa viewed, onc again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _chaldean oracles_ and probabl inventor of qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possibl bridg between christian and platonism, and, at time (a in voltaire), as a symbol of non-christian wisdom. after western philolog rediscov zarathushtra dure the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, friedrich nietzsche, in an intent paradox, gave the name zarathustra to the hero of hi work _also sprach zarathustra_ (1883- 1892). nietzsch saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discov the true motiv forc underli all things, that is, the etern struggl between good and evil.

provid you with food, then you can be stupid and unemploy and it' ok. thi is whi marri women usual didn't work until recent decades. 2. author figures, such as god, whoever wa behind the vietnam war,

on a silver platter. onc they had gain knowledg and (bi seek it) show their abil to make matur decis for them- selves, they no longer need to be treat like littl children and were reward by be allow into the \"real world.\" lesson from new interpretation: 1. ignor is bad. knowledg is good, but must be sought. 2. have food provid for you for noth (read \"welfare\") is at best a temporari measure. get a job and feed yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3. public nuditi is bad. cover up is good. 4. author figur are often wrong. normal peopl are intellig and should consid whether the instruct are realli a good idea and \"alter or abolish\" bad governments. they should think for themselves. 5. peopl in subordin decis are often discourag from knowledg but should seek it anyway, and all the harder. for example, poor children without good school should work especi hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves). i have tent name thi new philosophi \"the church of eveism\" becaus eve' decis to eat the appl is man[sic]kind' first good decision, instead of it first bad one, as tradit believed. she is therefor clearli a protagonist. god at first appear evil, for tell peopl not to seek knowledg but on deeper analysi is also a protagonist. as god reward the decis to defi him, and provid the tree in the first place, the intent and desir were clearli to have the knowledg be obtained, but to delay it until it wa activ sought. ---end seriou discussion. begin humor.-- save thi post to disk (or file server). someday it will be consid the most import write sinc

of cours not. and what about bisexuals? are they half-nazis? i don't know whi it would be so difficult to believ that some nazi were homosexuals. the german offic corp befor ww1, for instance, wa notori for it homosexuality. there were numer scandal which rock the german govt. dure the late 19th and earli 20th century. mani of the kaiser' friend were prosecut - the kaiser wa no homosexual, but the germani armi had a long tradit of toler homosexuality, go far back into prussian histori - back to frederick the great at least, who wa himself a homosexual. roehm wa a product of thi prussian offic tradition, and the old german armi (like the english public school system), be a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quit will to overlook roehm' homosexuality. in addition, some nazi complain of homosexu in the hitler youth. the hitler youth swallow up all pre-nazi youth groups, and some of the variou pre-war vandervogel, bund, and volkish youth group were known to promot homoerot ideal and friendship, and in mani cases, homosexu itself. so it seem to me not unlik that there were plenti of homosexu nazis, regardless of the offici nazi dogma concern the \"evils\" of homosexuality. whi should thi supris anyone?

(note: thi paragraph record not onli rams \"divin word,\" but also that there were thousand of wit to the event. now from the heart of battle.) then hi majesti drove at a gallop and charg the forc of the foe from hitti, be alon by himself, none other with him. hi majesti proceed to look about him and found 2500 chariot ring him on hi way out ... no offic wa with me, no charioteer, no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; my infantry, my chariotri yield befor them, not one of them stood firm to fight with them. hi majesti spoke: \"what is this, father amun? is it right for a father to ignor hi son? are my deed a matter for you to ignore? do i not walk and stand at your word? i have not neglect an order you gave. too great is he, the great lord of egypt, to allow alien to step on hi path! what are these asiat to you, o amun, the wretch ignor of god? have i not made for you mani great monuments, ... i call to you, my father amun, i am among a host of strangers; all countri are array against me, i am alone, there' none with me! ... the labor of mani peopl are nothing, amun is more help than they; i came here by the command of your mouth, o amun, i have not transgress your command!\" now though i pray in a distant land, my voic resound in southern thebes. i found amun came when i call to him, he gave me hi hand and i rejoiced. he call from behind as if near by: \"forward, i am with you, i your father, my hand is with you, i prevail over a hundr thousand men, i am lord of victory, lover of valor!\" i found my heart stout, my breast in joy, all i did succeeded, i wa like mont. ... i slaughter among them at my will, not one look behind him, not one turn around, whoever fell down did not rise. ... one call out to the other saying: \"no man is he who is among us, it is seth great-of-strength, baal in person; not deed of man are these hi doings, they are of one who is unique, who fight a hundr thousand without soldier and chariots, come quick, flee befor him, to seek life and breath air; for he who attempt to get close to him, hi hands, all hi limb grow limp. one cannot hold either bow or spears, when one see him come race along!\" my majesti hunt them like a griffin, i slaughter among them unceasingly. so you see brian, we have a few origin manuscript record the miracul battl between the rams and the hittites. do you reject them as be *completely* true? i suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words: \"question the exist of alexand the great, tilgrath pilisar iii, nero, caligula, josephus, cyru the great, artexerxes?\" do you also therebi question all their documents? that` the problem with your \"all or nothing\" approach. mani ancient peopl use to mix a bit of fanci with their facts. so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter (and the rest of the new testament) or accept no record of antiqu at all, forc you thereby, to accept the veriti of document you probabl do not find complet

three points. first, thi is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth. for instance, do the million of hindu' past and present who testifi to the realiti of brahma, constitut actual evid for the exist of brahma? how would you answer your own question in regard to the testimoni of hindus: \"with a scoff of your keyboard, with near complet ignor of the testimonies, are you go to say that that is all complet hooey?\" if you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you object justifi your own special pleading? second, it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testifi to jesus. you can claim it to be clear, but that doe not make it true. third, it is quit arguabl that abraham lincoln wa not christian, and that he had both a public and a privat view of christianity. in fact there wa much discuss about it in hi day (yes, he wa public accus of be a deist. oh my). i am present collect a faq for lincoln as i'v previous done for tyre, jefferson

subject: larsonian astronomy, physics, creation the follow partial summari of a theori of the univers includ a little-known descript of the creation of our solar system: larsonian astronomi and physic orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicist claim to be look for a \"unifi field theory\" in which all of the forc of the univers can be explain with a singl set of law or equations. but they have been systemat ignor or suppress an excel one for 30 years! the late physicist dewey b. larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, which he call the \"reciproc system\", is built on two fundament postul about the physic and mathemat natur of space and time: (1) \"the physic univers is compos entir of one component, motion, exist in three dimensions, in discret units, and in two reciproc forms, space and time.\" (2) \"the physic univers conform to the relat of ordinari commut mathematics, it magnitud are absolute, and it geometri is euclidean.\" from these two postulates, larson develop a complet theoret universe, use variou combin of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotat motions, the concept of in-ward and out-ward scalar motions, and speed in relat to the speed of light (which larson call \"unit velocity\" and \"the natur datum\"). at each step in the development, larson wa abl to match object in hi theoret univers with object in the real physic universe, (photons, sub-atom particl [incomplet atoms], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binari star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, etc.), even object not yet discov then (such as explod galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts). and appli hi theori to hi new model of the atom, larson wa abl to precis and accur calcul inter- atom distanc in crystal and molecules, compress and thermal expans of solids, and other properti of matter. all of thi is describ in good detail, with-out fanci complex mathematics, in hi books. book of dewey b. larson the follow is a complet list of the late physicist dewey b. larson' book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe. some of the earli book are out of print now, but still avail through inter-librari loan. \"the structur of the physic universe\" (1959) \"the case against the nuclear atom\" (1963) \"beyond newton\" (1964) \"new light on space and time\" (1965) \"quasar and pulsars\" (1971) \"noth but motion\" (1979) [a $9.50 substitut for the $8.3 billion \"super collider\".] [the last four chapter explain chemic bonding.] \"the neglect fact of science\" (1982) \"the univers of motion\" (1984) [final solut to most all astrophys mysteries.] \"basic properti of matter\" (1988) all but the last of these book were publish by north pacif publishers, p.o. box 13255, portland, or 97213, and should be avail via inter-librari loan if your local univers or public librari doesn't have each of them. sever of them, includ the last one, are avail from: the intern societi of unifi scienc (isus), 1680 e. atkin ave., salt lake city, utah 84106. thi is the organ that wa start to promot larson' theory. they have other relat publications, includ the quarterli journal \"reciprocity\". physicist dewey b. larson' background physicist dewey b. larson wa a retir engin (chemic or electrical). he wa about 91 year old when he die in may 1989. he had a bachelor of scienc degre in engin scienc from oregon state university. he develop hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers while tri to develop a way to comput chemic properti base onli on the element used. larson' lack of a fanci \"ph.d.\" degre might be one reason that orthodox physicist are ignor him, but it is not a valid reason. sometim it take a rel outsid to clearli see the forest through the trees. at the same time, it is clear from hi book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomi as well as ani physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their contradictions, ad hoc assumptions, principl of impotence, in-consistencies, etc.. larson did not have the funds, etc. to experiment test hi theory. and it wa not necessari for him to do so. he simpli compar the variou part of hi theori with other researchers' experiment and observ data. and in mani cases, hi explan fit better. a self-consist theori is much more than the orthodox physicist and astronom have! they claim to be look for a \"unifi field theory\" that works, but have been ignor one for over 30 year now! \"modern physics\" doe not explain the physic univers so well. some part of some of larson' book are full of quotat of lead orthodox physicist and astronom who agree. and rememb that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., also onc seem to explain it well, but were later prove conceptu wrong. prof. frank h. meyer, professor emeritu of uw-superior, was/i a strong propon of larson' theory, and wa (or still is) presid of larson' organization, \"the intern societi of unifi science\", and editor of their quarterli journal \"reciprocity\". he move to minneapoli after retiring. \"super collider\" boondoggle! i am against contruct of the \"superconduct super collider\", in texa or anywher else. it would be a gross wast of money, and contribut almost noth of \"scientific\" value. most physicist don't realiz it, but, accord to the comprehens gener unifi theori of the late physicist dewey b. larson, as describ in hi books, the strang goofi particl (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", alleg \"quarks\", etc.) which they are find in exist collid (fermi lab, cern, etc.) are realli just atom of anti-matter, which are creat by the high-energi collid beams, and which quickli disintegr like cosmic ray becaus they are incompat with their environment. a larger and more expens collid will onli creat a few more element of anti-matt that the physicist have not seen there before, and the physicist will be even more confus than they are now! are a few more type of anti-matt atom worth the $8.3 billion cost?!! don't we have much more import use for thi wast money?! anoth thing to consid is that the primari propos locat in texa ha a seriou and grow problem with some kind of \"fire ants\" eat the insul off underground cables. how much poison of the ground and ground water with insecticid will be requir to keep the ant out of the \"supercollider\"?! name the \"super collider\" after ronald reagon, as proposed, is total absurd! if it is built, it should be name after a lead particl physicist. larsonian anti-matt in larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, anti-matt is not a simpl case of opposit charg of the same type of particles. it ha more to do with the rate of vibrat and rotat of the photon of which they are made, in relat to the vibrat and rotat equival of the speed of light, which larson call \"unit velocity\" and the \"natur datum\". in larson' theory, a positron is actual a particl of matter, not anti-matter. when a positron and electron meet, the rotat vibrat (charges) and rotat of their respect photon (of which they are made) neutral each other. in larson' theory, the anti-matt half of the physic univers ha three dimens of time, and onli one dimens of space, and exist in a reciproc relationship to our materi half. larsonian rel the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercuri ha been observ and precis measur to advanc at the rate of 574 second of arc per century. 531 second of thi advanc are attribut via calcul to gravit perturb from the other planet (venus, earth, jupiter, etc.). the remain 43 second of arc are be use to help \"prove\" einstein' \"gener theori of relativity\". but the late physicist dewey b. larson achiev result closer to the 43 second than \"gener relativity\" can, by instead use \"special relativity\". in one or more of hi books, he appli the lorentz transform on the high orbit speed of mercury. larson total reject \"gener relativity\" as anoth mathemat fantasy. he also reject most of \"special relativity\", includ the part about \"mass increases\" near the speed of light, and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts, (those quasar with red-shift greater than 1.000 realli are move faster than the speed of light, although most of that motion is away from us in time.). in larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, there are three dimens of time instead of onli one. but two of those dimens can not be measur from our materi half of the physic universe. the one dimens that we can measur is the clock time. at low rel speeds, the valu of the other two dimens are negligible; but at high speeds, they becom significant, and the lorentz transform must be use as a fudg factor. [larson often use the term \"coordin time\" when write about this.] in regard to \"mass increases\", it ha been proven in atom acceler that acceler drop toward zero near the speed of light. but the formula for acceler is acceler = forc / mass, (a = f/m). orthodox physicist are ignor the third factor: force. in larson' theory, mass stay constant and forc drop toward zero. forc is actual a motion, or combin of motions, or relat between motions, includ inward and outward scalar motions. the expans of the universe, for example, is an outward scalar motion inher in the univers and not a result of the so-cal \"big bang\" (which is yet anoth mathemat fantasy). the univers of motion i wish to recommend to everyon the book \"the univers of motion\", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacif publishers, (p.o. box 13255, portland, oregon 97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. it contain the astrophys portion of a gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by that author, an unrecogn genius, more than thirti year ago. it contain final solut to most all astrophys mysteries, includ the format of galaxies, binari and multipl star systems, and solar systems, the true origin of the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the true natur of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, explod galaxies, etc.. it contain what astronom and astrophysicist are all look for, if they are readi to serious consid it with open minds! the follow is an exampl of hi theory' success: in hi first book in 1959, \"the structur of the physic universe\", larson predict the exist of explod galaxies, sever year befor astronom start find them. they are a necessari consequ of larson' comprehens theory. and when quasar were discovered, he had an immedi relat explan for them also. gamma-ray burst astro-physicist and astronom are still scratch their head about the mysteri gamma-ray bursts. they were origin thought to origin from \"neutron stars\" in the disc of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescop now in earth orbit ha been detect them in all direct uniformly, and their sourc locat in space do not correspond to ani known objects, (except for a few case of direct coincidence). gamma-ray burst are a necessari consequ of the gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson. accord to page 386 of hi book \"the univers of motion\", publish in 1984, the gamma-ray burst are come from supernova explos in the anti-matt half of the physic universe, which larson call the \"cosmic sector\". becaus of the relationship between the anti-matt and materi halv of the physic universe, and the way they are connect together, the gamma-ray burst can pop into our materi half anywher in space, seemingli at random. (thi is whi the sourc locat of the burst do not correspond with known objects, and come from all direct uniformly.) i wonder how close to us in space a sourc locat would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth! there would be no way to predict one, nor to stop it! perhap some of the mass extinct of the past, which are now be blame on impact of comet and asteroids, were actual caus by nearbi gamma-ray bursts! larsonian binari star format about half of all the star in the galaxi in the vicin of the sun are binari or double. but orthodox astronom and astrophysicist still have no satisfactori theori about how they form or whi there are so mani of them. but binari star system are actual a like consequ of the comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson. i will tri to summar larson explanation, which is detail in chapter 7 of hi book \"the univers of motion\" and in some of hi other books. first of all, accord to larson, star do not gener energi by \"fusion\". a small fraction come from slow gravit collapse. the rest result from the complet annihil of heavi element (heavier than iron). each element ha a destruct temperatur limit. the heavier the element is, the lower is thi limit. a star' intern temperatur increas as it grow in mass via accret and absorpt of the decay product of cosmic rays, gradual reach the destruct temperatur limit of lighter and lighter elements. when the intern temperatur of the star reach the destruct temperatur limit of iron, there is a type i supernova explosion! thi is becaus there is so much iron present; and that is relat to the structur of iron atom and the atom build process, which larson explain in some of hi book [better than i can]. when the star explodes, the lighter materi on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light. the heavier materi in the center portion of the star wa alreadi bounc around at close to the speed of light, becaus of the high temperature. the explos push that materi over the speed of light, and it expand outward in time, which is equival to inward in space, and it often actual disappear for a while. over long period of time, both mass start to fall back gravitationally. the materi that had been blown outward in space now start to form a red giant star. the materi that had been blown outward in time start to form a white dwarf star. both star then start move back toward the \"main sequence\" from opposit direct on the h-r diagram. the chanc of the two mass fall back into the exact same locat in space, make a singl lone star again, are near zero. they will instead form a binari system, orbit each other. accord to larson, a white dwarf star ha an invers densiti gradient (i densest at it surface), becaus the materi at it center is most wide dispers (blown outward) in time. thi elimin the need to resort to mathemat fantasi about \"degener matter\", \"neutron stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. larsonian solar system format if the mass of the heavi materi at the center of the explod star is rel small, then, instead of a singl white dwarf star, there will be sever \"mini\" white dwarf star (revolv around the red giant star, but probabl still too far away in three-dimension time to be affect by it heat, etc.). these will becom planets! in chapter 7 of the univers of motion, larson use all thi information, and other principl of hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, to deriv hi own version of bode' law. \"black hole\" fantasy! i heard that physicist stephen w. hawk recent complet a theoret mathemat analysi of two \"black holes\" merg togeth into a singl \"black hole\", and conclud that the new \"black hole\" would have more mass than the sum of the two origin \"black holes\". such a result should be recogn by everyon as a red flag, caus widespread doubt about the whole idea of \"black holes\", etc.! after read physicist dewey b. larson' book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, especi hi book \"the univers of motion\", it is clear to me that \"black holes\" are noth more than mathemat fantasies! the strang object at cygnu x-1 is just an unusu massiv white dwarf star, not the \"black hole\" that orthodox astronom and physicist so badli want to \"prove\" their theory. by the way, i do not understand whi so much public is be given to physicist stephen hawking. the physicist and astronom seem to be act as if hawking' sever physic problem somehow make him \"wiser\". it doe not! i wish the same attent had been given to physicist dewey b. larson while he wa still alive. widespread public and attent should now be given to larson' theory, books, and organ (the intern societi of unifi science). electro-magnet propuls i heard of that concept mani year ago, in connect with ufo' and unorthodox inventors, but i never wa abl to find out how or whi they work, or how they are constructed. i found a possibl clue about whi they might work on page 112-113 of the book \"basic properti of matter\", by the late physicist dewey b. larson, which describ part of larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe. i quot one paragraph: \"a indic in the preced chapter, the develop of the theori of the univers of motion arriv at a total differ concept of the natur of electr resistance. the electrons, we find, are deriv from the environment. it wa brought out in volum i [larson' book \"noth but motion\"] that there are physic process in oper which produc electron in substanti quantities, and that, although the motion that constitut these electron are, in mani cases, absorb by atom structures, the opportun for util thi type of motion in such structur are limited. it follow that there is alway a larg excess of free electron in the materi sector [materi half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged. in thi uncharg state the electron cannot move with respect to extens space, becaus they are inher rotat unit of space, and the relat of space to space is not motion. in open space, therefore, each uncharg electron remain perman in the same locat with respect to the natur refer system, in the manner of a photon. in the context of the stationari spatial refer system the uncharg electron, like the photon, is carri outward at the speed of light by the progress of the natur refer system. all materi aggreg are thu expos to a flux of electron similar to the continu bombard by photon of radiation. meanwhil there are other processes, to be discuss later, wherebi electron are return to the environment. the electron popul of a materi aggreg such as the earth therefor stabil at an equilibrium level.\" note that in larson' theory, uncharg electron are also massless, and are basic photon of light of a particular frequenc (abov the \"unit\" frequency) spin around one axi at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate). (\"unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are vibrat and rotat equival to the speed of light, accord to larson' theory.) [i might have the \"above\" and \"below\" label mix up.] larson is say that outer space is fill with mass- less un-charg electron fli around at the speed of light! if thi is true, then the electro-magnet propuls field of spacecraft might be abl to interact with these electrons, or other particl in space, perhap give them a charg (and mass) and shoot them toward the rear to achiev propulsion. (in larson' theory, an electr charg is a one-dimension rotat vibrat of a particular frequenc (abov the \"unit\" frequency) superimpos on the rotat of the particle.) the paragraph quot abov might also give a clue to confus meteorologist about how and whi lightn is gener in clouds. suppress of larsonian physic the comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson ha been avail for more than 30 years, publish in 1959 in hi first book \"the structur of the physic universe\". it is total un-scientif for hawking, wheeler, sagan, and the other sacr priest of the religion they call \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as the \"scientific\" literatur and the \"education\" systems, to total ignor larson' theori ha they have. larson' theori ha excel explan for mani thing now puzzl orthodox physicist and astronomers, such as gamma-ray burst and the natur of quasars. larson' theori deserv to be honestli and openli discuss in the physics, chemistry, and astronomi journals, in the u.s. and elsewhere. and at least the basic principl of larson' theori should be includ in all relat cours at uw-ec, uw-madison, cambridge, cornel university, and elsewhere, so that student are not kept in the dark about a worthi altern to the dogma they are be fed. for more information, answer to your questions, etc., pleas consult my cite sourc (especi larson' books). un-alt reproduct and dissemin of thi import partial summari is encouraged. robert e. mcelwain b.s., physic and astronomy, uw-ec newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84450 from: lwb@cs.utexas.edu (lanc w. bledsoe) subject: re: on-lin copi of book of mormon in articl <1993apr23.163823.24226@ads.com> wmoore@ads.com (william moore) writes: >can anyon provid me a ftp site where i can obtain a onlin version >of the book of mormon. pleas email the internet address if possible. i have a copy. whi are you interested?

element of truth, but jesu explain it far better and gave reasons. thoma paine, benjamin franklin, thoma jefferson are mere men. they can screw up the bibl just as well as ani man. i do not put these men on a pedestal. and if i rememb t.j.' autobiographi correctly, he thought thoma pain wa the most unread man he ever met. here' some more circular reason to you. paul say to the corinthian that \"that the gospel will be foolish to the world, becaus it is spiritu discerned.\" and so, peopl without the spirit of god haven't a clue to what the bibl is saying. from your point of view, that' incred circular and convenient. to me, it is mysteri and supernatur bizarre. i can see it, but you can't. thi is not arrog on my part. trust me. it is as bizarr to you as it is to me. but nonetheless, it is a truth, explain or not. are ani of you color blind to red and green? i am. rememb those dot test they do at the optomologist's? they put pictur in front of you and you are suppos to identifi the pattern in the dots? if your eye are perfectli normal, you can see letter or numer embed in the dots. they are a slightli differ color and stand out from the background. but if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anyth but gray-shad dots. that is how a dot test appear to me. i do not see a pattern at all. a normal see person will see the patterns. and to him, i seem like a total anomaly. to him, i appear as if i am miss the univers or something. it is hard for him to understand whi i can't see anyth that to him is as plain as day. that it what it is like with the bible, the word of god, to the believer. the believ can see the mean in the words. i can see how the pattern fit together. there is such depth. such consistency. but then, on the other hand, i notic the non-believer. he doesn't see it. he think i am weird becaus he think i am see things. i look at him, and say, \"no, you are weird. you do not see.\" then it is time for a saniti check. i go to anoth christian and say, \"do you see this.\" and they go, \"yes. it is an \"x\"\". and i say, \"thank god, i see the \"x\" too.\" it is truli the strangest thing. it add a littl extra dimens to the phrase, \"he will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\" i am glad that jesu ha enabl me to see. i wish everi non-believ could see what they are missing. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84511 from: tbrent@bank.ecn.purdue.edu (timothi j brent) subject: re: a messag for you mr. president: how do you know what happened?

(in the bibl it ha noth to do with fire!) most modern bibic translat admit that the use in the english word hell to translat hade and sheol are an unfortun and mislead practice. why? becaus when see the word \"hell\" mani reader imput to it the tradit connot of an ever-burn inferno, when thi wa never remot intend in the greek languag or in old english! in it true bibic usag hade doe inde refer to the state or abod of the dead, but not in the sens of spirit walk around in some sort of \"shadowi realm.\" hade is simpli the abod we call the grave. all dead go to thi hell. the second \"hell\" of the bible, tartaros, is mention onli onc in scripture, 2 pet.2:4; \"for if god spare not the angel that sinned, but cast them down to hell (tartaros), and deliv them into chain of dark to be reserv unto judgment...\" follow their rebellion to unseat god from hi throne (isa.14:12-14; rev.12:4), the archangel lucif (now satan) and a third of the creat angel (now demons) were eject from heaven (luke 10:18). they were cast down to tartaros, a place or condit of restraint that god ha impos on the mutin angel as they await ultim judgment (jude 6; 1 cor.6:3). tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that appli onli to evil, rebelli angel or demon (it is interest that the ancient greek use thi word to describ the place in which zeu confin the rebelli titans). nowher in the bibl is there ani mention of men be put into thi particular \"hell\". the the third word that is translat as \"hell\" in the bibl is gehenna. it come from the hebrew gai hinnom, mean \"valley of hinniom.\" hinnom is a deep, narrow ravin locat to the south and southwest of jerusalem. in old testament time it wa a place of abomin pagan rites, includ infant sacrific (it wa there that the apost king ahaz and manasseh made their children \"pass through the fire\" to the god molech. the rite were specif celebr in tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief grove in the valley). king josiah of ancient judah final put an end to these abominations. he defil the valley, render it ceremoni unclean (2 king 23:10). later the valley becam the cesspool and citi dump of jerusalem; a repositori for sewage, refus and anim carcasses. the bodi of dispis crimin were also burn there along with the rubbish. fire burn continuously, feed by a constant suppli of garbag and refuse. aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchas with the money juda receiv for the betray of christ (matt.27:8) wa also in part of the valley of hinnom. so what doe thi valley call gehenna have to do with hell? in rev.19:20: the satan inspir polit dictat and a miracle-work religi figure, the fals prophet, work with him will resist the re-establish of the govern of god by jesu christ at hi second coming. their fate is reveal by the apostl john: \"and the beast wa taken, and with him the fals prophet... these both were cast aliv into a lake of fire burn with brimstone.\" where will thi temporari lake of fire (thi \"hell\") be? the prophet isaiah wrote of thi lake of fire prepar for the beast: \"for tophet (in the valley of hinnom) is ordain of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindl it\" (isa.30:33). one thousand year later, satan himself will be cast into thi rekindl fieri lake where the beast and fals prophet were cast! (rev.20:10). but what of the wick who have die over the millennia? doe the bibl say that they are now suffer fieri punish for their sin in a lake of fire? in the sequenc of rev.20 the incorrig wick are resurrect to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there! (rev.20:15). what will becom of these wicked? will they writh in flame for eternity? the wick will be burn up from the intens heat of the come gehenna fire on the earth. they wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed! thi punish will be everlast (perman and final). the bibl call it the \"second death\" (rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibl of a further resurrection. the bibl doe teach etern punishment, but not etern punishing. the prophet malachi provid a graphic description. \"for, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\" (4:1). to the righteous, god say that the wick shall be \"ash under the sole of your feet...\"(mal.4:3). gehenna wa a place of destruct and death, not a place of live torture! jesu wa talk to jew who understood all about thi gehenna or valley of hinnom. utter destruct by fire wa complete. noth wa left, but ashes! everi text in the bibl translat from thi greek word gehenna mean complet destruction, not live tortur (not etern life in torment)! the bibl says, in roman 6:23, \"the wage of sin is death\", not etern life in torture. the punish reveal in the bibl is death... the cessat of life. etern life is the gift of god! newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84562 from: sbuckley@fraser.sfu.ca (stephen buckley) subject: re: cult (who keep them go ?) muttiah@thistle.ecn.purdue.edu (ranjan s muttiah) writes: >in articl <sbuckley.735337212@sfu.ca> sbuckley@fraser.sfu.ca (stephen buckley) writes: >>>... bad thought these. >> >> well it depend on whether you take the liter dictionari definit of >>cult and say all faith are cults, or if you take a more social-context >>view of \"cult which allow you to recogn mainstream religion as >>socially-accept and cult as group that involv techniqu of brain- >>wash and all the other characterist that defin oppress [probli not >>the *best* word] cult behaviour. >yeah, but implicitli the social-context view provid a justif >for the dictionari definit of a cult; those who follow the mainstream >pretend while those in cult act base on the veri same impulses. now >who is to be taken serious ?

_3,700-year tradit still glow - 'assimil in u.s. threaten ancient zoroastrian religion'_ by jeann huber, mercuri news staff writer high on a hillsid abov san jose, flame leap up 24 hour a day from a gleam brass urn in a templ - one of onli four in the unit state - dedic to one of the world' most ancient religions. with the flame go the prayer of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrian that their faith will surviv thi land. \"there is a fear - a real fear, too,\" said silloo tarapor of lafayette. \"we have one gener to do it or to die.\" mani immigr group struggl to maintain an ident in a strang land. but for zoroastrians, it is an especi poignant concern. their religion ha been around for perhap 3,700 years, a heritag so deep it scarc seem comprehens in a state where \"histor sites\" are sometim less than 100 year old. it wa the religion of the great persian empir under king cyru and darius. and tradit say that when christ wa born about 500 year later, he wa honor by a visit from three zoroastrian priests, the magi. scholar say mani key belief of christians, jew and muslim can be trace to the teach of zoroaster, the zoroastrian prophet. yet, with onli about 150,000 zoroastrian in the entir world, they are a miniscul minor in everi countri in which they live. surviv as a peopl is veri much on their minds. ironically, local zoroastrian fear that the almost unlimit toler of the unit state may do what hundr of year of persecut follow by nearli 1,000 year of benign religi segreg could not do: caus their young peopl to stop think of themselv as zoroastrians. zoroastrian do not believ their is the onli right religion, and they actual shun the notion of tri to win converts. so if their children becom total assimilated, they say, it' their children - rather than the world at larg - who will be the losers. \"it' import to have an identity,\" said maneck bhujwaia of san jose, a leader among zoroastrian who came here from india. \"it' import for everybodi - irish, scottish, americans. it give mean to life. you don't have to depend on the major commun to give you respect. you can fall back on your own identity.\" for zoroastrians, there' much to be proud of. their prophet, zoroaster, seek to make sens of a cultur in which anim sacrific to multipl god wa common, preach that there wa onli one god, a good one. zoroastrian call their god ahura mazda, which translat as lord of wisdom and light. _good vs. evil_ zoroast saw life as a constant struggl between good and evil, with the good eventu winning. men and women could join in the battl for good, he said, and he warn that they would inevit suffer consequ such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong. he preach honesty, charity, kind to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equal of men and women - basic virtu preach by prophet of mani religions. but zoroast wa perhap unusu in that he told hi follow not to follow him blindly. he demand they think for themselves. in fact, joseph campbell, the famou scholar of the histori and mean of myths, trace the western emphasi on individu thought to the zoroastrians. zoroastrian have mani word for thought. their motto, lead into a stain glass window over the sacr fire at the templ on the slope of mount hamilton, is \"good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\" so it' not surpris that zoroastrian valu educ highly. in india, where a conting of zoroastrian arriv in the ninth centuri to escap persecut by muslim in iran, zoroastrian claim 100 percent literacy; the overal statist in india is just 60 percent. about half of the bay area zoroastrian commun came here from india and pakistan, mostli to studi at universities. the other half fled from iran after the 1979 revolut made that a fundamentalist islam state where other had no rights. local zoroastrian point with pride to way their emphasi on \"good deeds\" ha improv life in everi countri they inhabit. in san jose, the recent restor of the hotel saint clari came about becaus manou mobedshahi, a san francisco-bas hotelier, pass the boarded-up downtown landmark on hi way to and from the temple. at the temple' dedication, the chief guest of honor wa the mother of zubin mehta, the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmon orchestra. the templ exist becaus of anoth good deed: the decis by an iranian emigre, the late arbab rustom guiv, to buy land for six templ in north america. besid the 10-acr site off crother road on mount hamilton, he paid for land in lo angeles, chicago, new york, toronto, and vancouver. until hi gifts, there were no zoroastrian templ on thi continent. local zoroastrian rais money to build the actual temple, and the properti alreadi had a larg hous that they have convert to a commun center. the temple, dedic a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster, is a simpl structur with gleam white walls, vault ceil and oak floors, partial cover with huge orient carpets. it central featur is the fire, set in the middl of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building. although zoroastrian are sometim call \"fire worshippers,\" they actual consid fire just a symbol of god. \"it help us concentrate, just like christian use the cross and muslim use the holi book,\" bhujwala said. the biggest celebr of the year occur in earli spring. for all iranians, includ zoroastrians, the new year begin on the first day of the season becaus of it symbol as the start of new life. with zoroaster' birthday just six day later, the combin of religi and secular holiday creat someth on par with what most of the unit state celebr between christma and jan. 1. for thi year' celebr of the prophet' birthday, about 500 peopl came to worship and revel. \"the good thing in life are not forbidden,\" esfandiar anoushiravani, a leader of the iranian members, had said beforehand, and what follow prove him right. insid the temple, worship fill everi chair and sat or stood around the edg of the room as about a half-dozen priest chant thanksgiv prayer around a tabl laden with brazier of smoke sandalwood, glass of milk and water, and a tray heap with dri fruit and nuts. kid crowd around, grab hand of the treats. \"peopl eat the fruit,\" tarapor said. \"it' a way to particip in the ceremony.\" _santa claus, sort of_ the gather even had a santa claus, iranian style. with flow white hair and a bag of gift for the children, thi amownaroz wore green symbol of spring) and red. he wa ush in by a sort of spring clown, hajefyrouz, who danc and play a tambourine. the zoroastrian from india were charmed. \"thi is all new for us, too,\" one told a visitor who ask what wa go on. a visitor, john a. sabanovich of folsom, said he becam intrigu with the religion year ago while on busi trip to iran. zoroastrian have no procedur for accept convert - a result, some say, of their centuri of persecut in iran follow by their promis to the hindu king who allow them into india that they would not interfer with hi people' religion. but that doe not stop sabavich from join in the celebr at the san jose templ whenev he can. \"when i first heard about thi religion,\" he said, \"i thought, my god, thi is what a religion should be.

matthew doe not say that juda did not fall; neither doe peter say that juda did not hang himself. thi is not a matter of one person call someth black and the other person call it white. both account can be true and supplementary. a possibl reconstruct would be this: juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave way and juda fell down the ledge, mangl hi bodi in the process. the fall could have been befor *or* after death as either would fit thi explanation. thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock on thi way down, tear hi bodi open. it is import to rememb that we are not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall. loui gaussen relat a stori of a man who wa determin to kill himself. thi individu place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at hi head. he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time. on the other hand, a person could say that thi man took hi life by shoot himself, while anoth could rightli contend he commit suicid by jump form the tall building. in thi case, both are true, as both are true in the case of matthew' and peter' account of the death of judas. it is mere a situat of differ perspect of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ your onli reason for reject thi is, i believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy. you haven't relat how thi is imposs or highli unlikely. here' what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ db [quot toni rose]... > there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. > therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock > on thi way down, tear hi bodi open. it is import to rememb that we > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > are not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanc > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > wa the decomposit of hi bodi befor hi fall. \"the ad text in thi version is so heavi that, assum you are truli so oppos to such tactics, you should find it not credible. but you seem to find toni rose' eisegesi satisfactory, while clearli reject david joslin's.\" _____________________________________________________________________ here, you discredit tony' explan base on what you deem too \"heavy\" for the passages. but you haven't address whi you feel that way. you can say it' a vain attempt to reconcil the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown whi you reject that possibility. questions: is matthew lie or is luke lying?

[^^^ above, mine] no you can't onli conclud this, although, as toni says, thi wa a highli probabl outcome. but matthew doe not state death as be a result. the greek word is apagcho. matthew 27:5 is it' onli occurr in the new testament. in the septuagint (the greek translat of the ot use at the time of jesus), it' onli use in 2 samuel 17:23 : \"now when ahithophel saw that hi advic wa not followed, he saddl a donkey, and aros and went home to hi house, to hi city. then he put hi household in order, and hang himself, and died; and he wa buri in hi father' tomb.\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ notic that not onli is it state that ahithophel \"hang himself\" [gr. sept., apagcho], but it explicitli adds, \"and died\". here we have no doubt of the result. in matthew, we are not explicitli told juda died. also, there is noth in the greek to suggest success or failure. it simpli mean \"hang oneself\". db... \"but mr decenso, you are more than welcom to disagre and show more reput ^^^^^^^^^ christian scholar that insist that the hang wa not successful.\" my reply... [^^^above, mine] \"reputable\"? you mean one that have never erred? as far as insist that the hang wa unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^ as i said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ although i still agre with tony' exegesi as be the most probabl explan regard judas' death (take into account sever criteria), i'v recent notic some new thing in matthew. mat 27:5-8 then he threw down the piec of silver in the templ and departed, and went and hang himself. but the chief priest took the silver piec and said, \"it is not law to put them into the treasury, becaus they are the price of blood.\" and they consult togeth and bought with them the potter' field, to buri stranger in. therefor that field ha been call the field of blood to thi day. first of all, notic that the text doe not say that juda die as a result of hanging. all it say is that he \"went and hang himself.\" luke however, in acts, tell us that \"and fall headlong, he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out.\" thi is a pretti clear indic (along with the other detail given in act - peter' speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after judas' fall, he wa dead. so the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highli probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________ i also wrote...

explain how juda died; he doe ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say juda \"hang himself\", but he didn't specif say juda die in the hang incident. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ however, act seem to show us hi graphic demise. therefore, there is no contradict between matthew and act re: judas' `death'. ....... my reply... ...we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and act probabl record hi death. although it' possibl and plausibl that he fell from the hang and hit some rocks, therebi burst open, i can no longer assum that to be the case. therefore, no contradiction. matthew did not say juda die as a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he? most scholar believ he probabl did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________ i quot all that to show that i highli regard the scholars' explanations, but in look at the text initially, we can't assum juda died. it is, however, highli probable. ^^^^^^ db... \"bi the way, while all agre that juda die from the hanging, the book had differ way of deal with the contradict we are discussing. one simpli ignor it entir and simpli refer back to matthew' version as the correct version in both matt and acts. \"the biblic knowledg commentary\" suggest the hypothes that juda hung and then when he rotted, hi belli explod (which doesn't explain hi headlong fall), or that hi branch or rope broke, and he fell to hi death and hi gut gush out (which doesn't explain how a hang man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\" my reply... the outcom of ani fall is depend upon mani factors...how high the person wa suspend befor the fall, ani obstruct such as tree branch that may have deviat the fall, how steep an inclin of rocki surfac the victim fell upon, thu possibl roll or bounc of sever rocks, etc. in a superfici examin of the act passag and the matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geograph specifics, but toni in the abov quot post gave us some... _____________________________________________________________________ a possibl reconstruct would be this: juda hang himself on a tree on the edg of a precipic that overlook the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snap or the rope gave way and juda fell down the ledge, mangl hi bodi in the process. the fall could have been befor *or* after death as either would fit thi explanation. thi possibl is entir natur when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocki terrac 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easi to conclud that juda struck one of the jag rock on thi way down, tear hi bodi open. _____________________________________________________________________ db... now truthfully, i do not see what is comfort about matthew confus the sourc of the potter' field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: matthew doe make that confusion. of cours a biblic inerrantist who claim that everi word of the bibl is guarante true by god, will have to therebi add one more contradict to the death of juda (ie: where the prophesi of the potter' field came from).\" my reply... please, when we are done with thi studi on hi death, remind me to discuss thi with you. db... as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which juda purchas the land, wa inde for the betrayal, rather than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specif mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [act 1:18], it also specif mention what act of iniqu they were talk about (ie: act 1:16 \"...concern juda who wa guid to those who arrest jesus.\"). now i would point out that when the bibl describ an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immedi discuss \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inan to suggest that it wa an action of iniqu other than the one discussed.\" my reply... dave, we are get somewhere, aren't we! act 1:15 and in those day peter stood up in the midst of the discipl (altogeth the number of name wa about a hundr and twenty), and said, act 1:16 \"men and brethren, thi scriptur had to be fulfilled, which the holi spirit spoke befor by the mouth of david concern judas, who becam a guid to those who arrest jesus; act 1:17 \"for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministry.\" act 1:18 (now thi man purchas a field with the wage of iniquity; and fall headlong, he burst open in the middl and all hi entrail gush out. act 1:19 and it becam known to all those dwell in jerusalem; so that field is call in their own language, akel dama, that is, field of blood.) act 1:20 \"for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let hi dwell place be desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let anoth take hi office.' notic that in vers 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used. rather, it state that juda \"becam a guid to those who arrest jesus\". but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, \"for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministry.\" what part did juda play in their ministry? ^^^^^^ joh 12:6 thi he said, not that he care for the poor, but becaus he wa a thief, and had the money box; and he use to take what wa put in it. joh 13:29 for some thought, becaus juda had the money box, that jesu had said to him, \"buy those thing we need for the feast,\" or that he should give someth to the poor. so, now we know what part juda play - he wa a treasurer, per se. right after peter state that juda play a part in thi ministri (treasurer, accord to john), then luke add the parenthet explan of \"wage of iniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but wa stolen by juda to purchas a field. i believ thi is a better exeget explan of what the \"wage of iniquity\" are. what do you think, dave? db... \"now sinc i have given you clear answer (and even references), perhap you could unequivoc state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of ask me what type i think you are, as you did to mr joslin).\" my reply... i will gladli admit that i am a complet inerrantist, although i

admit ignor and incompet in thi example). thu i felt honor bound to do a better set of research specif on the word. first it should be note that greek grammar is not as tough as i first assum (it is not nontrivi by ani means, and i still am not compet with it, but it is not as opaqu as i had thought). it turn out that while the index for the bauer-arndt-gingrich \"greek lexicon\" render each vers in order, each word within a vers is put in greek alphabet order. thu while the the mean of the vers is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear. on the other hand, a greek-english intralinear bibl make thing a lot more comprehendable. and yes, the word for field in act 1:18 is inde \"chorion.\" now i'v check sever greek-english lexicons: \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" louw and nida \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament\" \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" grimm \"word studi concordance,\" tynsdal \"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian writings,\" bauer-arndt-gingrich \"the new analyt greek lexicon,\" perschbach in each case the mean of the word chorion wa given various as: a space, place, region, district, field, area, \"countri place,\" land, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings. nowher do ani of these book mention anyth about \"grave.\" as some of these book go into great detail, i would be veri surpris to find that these book are all inadequ and mr archer is the onli compet scholar in greek. i think it more like that mr archer' investig into \"contradictions\" to be onc again, as your friend said it, \"lack in substance,\" and thu archer is again shown worthless as an expert wit (bi the way mr decenso, i would have honor present my result on thi matter, even if i had found them to support mr archer' contentions). by the way, among these lexicons, (eg: robinson's) is the definit of \"agros,\" the word use in matthew 27 to describ the field bought. the word \"agros\" is defin as \"a field in the country.\" chorion is specif note as a synonym to agros. thi is significant, as it is evid of how silli bullinger' exegisi was, which state that the word for \"field\" in matthew (ie: agros) is differ from the word for \"field\" in act (ie: chorion), and thu we must be talk about two differ field (of cours you alreadi admit how stupid bullinger' exegisi is, but thi wa a small serendip which drive the point home). so as of now, unless mr decenso show compel reason to believ otherwis (eg: a reput scholar with reput references), i consid thi particular issu closed. see mr decenso, now you can go on to answer question about the denial of peter, the day of the crucifixion, tyre, and the fact that the author of matthew quot from the wrong prophet in discuss the \"potter' field.\" later, dave butler precis knowledg is the onli true knowledge, and he who doe not teach exactly, doe not teach at all. henri ward beecher american clergyman as record by

research as to the greek word \"apacgw,\" you will find that it doe denot success. those scholar did inde have an excel reason to assum that the suicid wa successful. as i point out, i recent check sever lexicons: \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" louw and nida \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament\" \"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" grimm \"word studi concordance,\" tynsdal \"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian writings,\" bauer-arndt-gingrich \"the new analyt greek lexicon,\" perschbach a coupl simpli state \"hang oneself\", and a coupl were more explicit and state that \"apacgw\" mean specif \"kill yourself by hanging.\" a coupl also note that the mean of one the root word for \"apacgw\" is \"strangle, throttl or choke\" (which pretti much invalid the guy who suggest to david joslin that juda wa hung upsid down). one of the best refer though, \"robinson' greek and english lexicon of the new testament,\" not onli state the translation, it gave both the root words, the liter translation, relat greek word which use the same roots, and also other present specif exampl of the word in greek literatur (to give further context). the word \"apagchw\" ha two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and the root word \"apo\" mean liter \"away.\" thi root word is includ in word which denot a transition. it can mean a transit in place (eg: the greek word \"apagello\" mean to send a message). \"apo\" can also denot a chang in state and specif the chang from life to death. robinson specif make comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which mean \"to kill.\" in liter mean the word \"apacgw\" mean \"to throttle, strangl to put out of the way,\" and implicitli denot a chang in life state (ie: away from life, to death). so while the word \"apacgw\" doe mean \"to hang,\" it specif denot a death as well. thu robinson is quit specif when he state that it mean \"to hang oneself, to end one' life by hanging.\" he then note the the use of \"apacgw\" in homer odessi 19:230 to denot context. he present that exampl of \"apacgw\" as be use to explicitli mean \"suicid by hanging.\" now sinc there is a perfectli good word for strangling, without the ad denot of \"death,\" and as you insist that the bibl wa written by god, and everi word is precic correct, you are stuck with the complet mean of \"apacgw\" (ie: sinc the word \"apacgw\" wa used, then death is denot as the result). by the way, i note that mr decenso also present an exampl of \"apacgw\": > in the septuagint (the greek translat of the ot use at the time of jesus), > it' onli use in 2 samuel 17:23 : \"now when ahithophel saw that hi advic > wa not followed, he saddl a donkey, and aros and went home to hi house,

\"hang himself\" [gr. sept., > apagcho], but it explicitli adds, \"and died\". here we have no doubt of the > result. > in matthew, we are not explicitli told juda died. note mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint wa a translat from hebrew to greek, and you have not shown the origin mean of the hebrew (ie\" the the hebrew say \"and died\"), and thu whether it wa simpli echo in the greek. it should also be point out that, regardless of the ad \"and died\", the correct translat would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did inde die from strangul (redundant, but correct). further, we have evid that the septuagint wa repeatedli rewritten and reedit (which includ version which contradict each other), and such edit wa not even necessarili execut by greeks. thu i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek. so, what you realli need to prove your point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someon commit \"apacgw\" and surviving. otherwis i would see you as simpli make worthless assert without correspond evidence. now i would note mr decenso, that everytim i go out of my way to research it one of your appar contriv exegisis, i pretti much find it false. thus, i think that if you are go to add to the text, someth over and abov what the sourc clearli says, then you had better have an explicit greek or histor sourc to justifi it. by the way, as to mr rose' statement about tree around the potter' field: > there are still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom. unless mr rose can show that these tree are two thousand year old, or that there are 2000 year old stump there, or ha a 2 thousand year old descript of the area which mention such trees, then it is inappropri for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the locat of the tree two thousand year ago (after all, thing change). now as to your other argument, ie: that the money juda use is not the same as the 30 silvers: > as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which juda purchas the land, wa inde for the betrayal, rather > than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specif > mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [act 1:18], it also specif mention > what act of iniqu they were talk about (ie: act 1:16 \"...concern > juda who wa guid to those who arrest

not stop there...vs. 17, \"for he wa number with us and > obtain a part in thi ministry.\" what part did juda play in their ministry? > ^^^^^^ true, peter (or the author of acts) doe not specif call judas' betray \"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither doe john specif call judas' action \"an iniquity\" either. further john 13:29 did not say that juda took the money box, but rather said: \"some thought that because, juda had the money box, jesu wa tell him \"buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give someth to the poor, so after receiv the morsel he immedi went out, and it wa night.\" note that it is said that juda left, it doe not say that he took the money box. thu when i see your explan it still seem to me you would choos the a an unproven iniquity, mention by anoth author, in a differ book, written at a differ time, over the iniqu explicitli mention by the author of acts. i find thi forc and contrived. of cours thi particular argument becom moot, sinc we have have seen evid that \"apacgw\" mean suicide. you see, sinc judas' hang wa successful, he could not have spent the money mention in john 13:29, becaus matthew and mark explicitli say the betray wa on the high holi day (ie: passover), and thu he could not have spent the money befor kill himself the next day. thu the money which bought the \"field of blood\" would have to have been the 30 piec of silver (of cours he got the 30 piec of silver that night as well, and thu couldn't have spent that either. oh dear, i believ that the hous of card is com down). mayb we should at thi point, discuss now whether jesu wa crucifi on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas. by the way, as to where the prophesi of the potter' field came from (ie: the mention of it in matthew), you say: > please, when we are done with thi studi on hi death, remind me to discuss > thi with you. i am remind you now to discuss it now. it' all part of the same vers we are discussing, and i wish you would quit procrastin and sidestep these issues. later, dave butler a wise man proport hi belief to the evidence. david hume, philosoph an inquiri concern human understand ps. i would note again, that you are not state that that bibl is not possibl inerrant; you are state that it *is* inerrant. sinc you have been, by your own admission, present mere \"possible\" reconcili (i of

young gay men who are just come out -- that they can shed their sexual by suppress their sexual urg and embrac christianity. \"we offer support to peopl who are seek to leav the sin of

end both their romanc and their busi partnership, caligiuri wa sexual assault by a man he pick up in a bar. \"i wa realli drunk,\" he recalls, \"and i went home with thi guy. he tie me up and rape me. he left me tie up all night, and the next morn he rape me again.\" when caligiuri wa eventu freed by the attacker, he return home to the home he share with hi ex-lover. \"he had anoth man there with him,\" caligiuri recalls. \"i thought at thi time, 'if thi is what be gay is about, i don't want to be thi way anymore.\" caligiuri vow that if he could find a way out, he would share hi discoveri with others. he organ an antigay conting to demonstr at phoenix' gay pride parad in june 1985, and a few month later free inde held it first public protest. at a meet to promot a gay civil right ordinance, free inde member loudli blast gays, tell them ther were sinner head for hell. free inde began receiv about a hundr telephon call a week, thank in part to a decept list in the local yellow pages. \"we were list under lesbian and gay altern services,\" caligiuri says, \"so peopl thought we were a gay inform switchboard. peopl would call to find out where the local bar were, and we'd preach to them about the sin of homo- sexuality.\" ruse like thi are typic of the movement, caligiuri says, adding, \"they'll do anyth to reach these people.\" \"david use to go on radio and say realli stupid things,\" recal peter kelly, a counselor at phoenix' cathol dioces aid program, \"like that he knew he wa gay when he start wear pastel colors.\" caligiuri' famili first found out about hi ministri when they saw him on raphael' syndic talk show in 1985. \"they were relieved,\" he recalls. \"they figur that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that i should be a 'reformed' gay person.\" but caligiuri wa hardli reformed. \"bi the time i appear on sally' show,\" \"i'd start have sex with men again. men would call our hotlin and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father. i wa horni all the time.\" unabl to risk go to gay bars, where he might be recogn from hi numer televis appearances, caligiuri say he \"use to go to bookstor and get blowjobs.\" when he wasn't work the bookstores, he wa sleep with other \"reformed\" homosexuals. \"i didn't realiz it at first, but a lot of the ha leader were have sex with one

may 1988, caligiuri wa have anonym sex a coupl time a week. when the show' host ask him if he ever \"act on temptation,\" hi answer wa a lie. caligiuri' duplic began to take it' toll on him, however. he wa suffer from chrinic fatigu syndrom and candidiasis, a dibilit yeast infection, and thi led to hi escap from the sect. \"i wa too sick to go to church,\" he explains. \"the more time i spent away from those peopl the more i began to feel like myself. i began to rememb who i use to be.\" late in 1991, caligiuri turn free inde phone line over to a local church and close the ministry' doors. \"i'd convinc myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says. today, caligiuri, 31, is studi altern spiritu (\"i'm interest- ed in belief system that aren't judgemental.\"), consid romanc (\"but not with a christian!\"), and search for a new project to devot himself to. \"i feel compel to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says. \"i want to eventu stop feel guilti about what i did and make up for the damag i may have brought to our community.\" ---end article--- caligiuri' tori is by no mean uniqu and i have read sever other articl of former leader and founder of 'ex-gay' ministri who have said veri similar th similar things. fortuant not all of them have left christianity, but have come to realiz that god love them despit the attitud of others. some, like chri glaser, director of the presbyterian \"lazaru project\" of west hollywood presbyterian church have actual been work with the gay commun to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encourag real ethic valu of sexual within the sphere of be gay. i have also, as i said talk and becom and becom close friend with mani who onc attend such group as \"love in action\" and others, who either onc claim to have been \"reformed\" or who were too honest with themselv to live a lie, no matter who wa disappoint in them. some were even encourag to marri as a way of \"sealing\" their new heterosexuality, onli to eventu start hit the bars, bathhous and bookstores, sinc these were usual activ under the conceal of night and one-night-stand of promiscu behavior meant no continu \"sin\" through a commit relationship. thi is a horribl trap which the church ha dump on the back of the truli gay orient people, and the veri inno- cent victim in these case are the wive and children of such marriages. yet the church insist that there are onli two option they are will to allow gay people: 1) heterosexu or 2) celebacy. thi is sad. what is also mrtifying, is in the case of those who cannot suppress their desir and fear for thier saniti in such a mix up confus that the church forc on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgic damper of the brain functions. in the past lobotomi and heavey drug suppress were common- place. there are now becom avail more and more literatur on the threat of coerciv christian toward gays, such as sylvia pennington' _\"ex-gays? there are none_. and others. there are also a great mani fact base book be written to help peopl trap in thi confus such as mauri johnston' _gay under grace_, and chri glaser' _come hom!_. i serious recommend those for

usage, definit six or eight might apply. note that these definit do not mean the same thing. in my mind, to say that scienc ha it basi in valu is a bit of a reach. scienc ha it basi in observ fact. even the usag of the word \"value\" abov do not denot observ fact, but rather a standard of measurement. i would conclud that scienc doe not have it basi in values, and so your statement abov fails. in fact, if one conclud that a scientif set of measur (values) are base on system deriv from observation, then it must follow that in a scientif context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \"object values.\" back to the present. thi ha noth to do with a moral system anyhow. just becaus the word \"values\" is use in both context doe not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts. if one is to argu for object valu (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstr that moral itself is objective. consid the mean of the word \"objective\" i doubt that thi

(a discuss of the issu in more or less these term is record in act 15.) howev there' more involved. in order to get a full pictur of the role of the law, we have to come to grip with paul' appar reject of the law, and how that relat to jesus' commend of the law. at least as i read paul, he say that the law serv a purpos that ha been in a certain sens superceded. again, thi issu isn't one of the abolit of the law. in the middl of hi discussion, paul note that he might be understood thi way, and assur us that that' not what he intend to say. rather, he see the law as primarili be present to convict peopl of their sinfulness. but ultim it' an imposs standard, and one that ha been superced by christ. paul' comment are not the world' clearest here, and not everyon agre with my reading. but the interest thing to notic is that even thi radic posit doe not entail an abolit of the law. it still remain as an uncompromis standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. for it purpos of convict of sin, it' import that it not be relaxed. howev for christians, it' not the end -- ultim we live in faith, not law. while the theoret categori they use are rather different, in the end i think jesu and paul come to a rather similar conclusion. the quot passag from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount, where jesu show us how he interpret the law. the \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather liter reading, but in fact that' not jesus' approach. jesus' interpret emphas the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremoni details. inde he is well known for take a rather free attitud toward the sabbath and kosher laws. some scholar claim that mat 5:17-20 need to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish discussions. jesu accus hi oppon of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglect the thing that realli matter: justice, merci and faith, and care about how cup and plate are cleaned, but not about the fact that insid the peopl who use them are full of extort and rapacity. (mat 23:23-25) this, and the discuss later in mat 5, suggest that jesu ha a veri specif view of the law in mind, and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength, he is think of these aspect of it. paul' conclus is similar. while he talk about the law be superceded, all of the specif exampl he give involv the \"ceremoni law\", such as circumcis and the sabbath. he is quit concern about maintain moral standards. the net result of thi is that when paul talk about the law be superceded, and jesu talk about the law be maintained, i believ they are talk about differ aspect of the law. paul is embroil in argument about circumcision. as is natur in letter respond to specif situations, he' look at the aspect of the law that is current caus trouble: the law as specif jewish ceremonies. he certainli doe not intend to abolish divin standard of conduct. on the other hand, when jesu commend the law, he seem to be talk the law in it broadest implic for moral and human relationships, and deemphas those aspect that were later to give paul so much trouble. it' unfortun that peopl use the same term in differ ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the way term like \"famili values\" take on special mean from the current context. imagin some poor historian of the futur tri to figur out whi \"famili values\" should be use as a code word for opposit to homosexu in one specif period in the u.s. i think law had taken on a similar role in the argument paul wa involv in. paul wa clearli not reject all of the jewish valu that go along with the term \"law\", ani more than peopl who concern about the \"famili values\" movement are realli oppos to famili values. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83535 from:

read your post, it wa noth new, i had seen much the same in other typical\"christian\" anti-gay sentiment literature. gay peopl are and will con- tinu to be persecut as long as such propaganda petpetuates. you may be unawar of all the statistica \"findings\" concern african-american that have been publish and use by variou group to re-enforc their own bia against african-americans. we usual think of the kkk in these instances, but there are mani other groups. of course, the vast major of the public scoff at such find and document today, but that wa not alway the case. fortun african-american had \"whites\" who support their 'cause' and public sentiment wa eventu (if not entirely) turn around. there wa even a civil war, and anti-negro sentiment increased. in fact, until law were put in place to protect the inalien right of black it wa pretti much legal to discrimin against them. i know mani gay and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination. you may think that i have been deceiv or something, that is your perogative. my church, christian church (discipl of christ) openli affirm the right of oppress peopl of all segment of society, includ gays. we believ the gospel messag of preach to all creation and make disciples. we believ in the lord' great command to love, and we beleiv in stand up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so. i realli like my church for last reason the most. i can find a church almost anywher in the valley that stand for the gospel and believ in the command of love (though i'm hard-press to find mani who actual sho love), but not mani are will to champion the oppressed, especi within their own community. i may have lost face with the greater christian commun for the unpopular of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionist against the oppress of african-americans. mani were even kill and treat as runaway slave for be \"nigger-lovers\" and such. i guess i'v decid the challeng is worth it. in my talk with gay men and women i have heard tragic stori after tragic stori center around fail marriages, wive and husband who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc. funni thing is, i don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continu to reject their gay famili member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like pflag. i'm apal by the legisl which pass in colorado, and am equal out0 rage that such slimey peopl as loui sheldon (from the tradit valu coalition) have been activ work in the christian underground to garner support within sever (8 i believe) state thi come novemb for more oppress legis against gays. perhap you don't get it, and mayb you never will. mani didn't get it in the middl age and the proclaim god' will be done as they massacr thousand in witch hunt and inquisitions. the messag that come through, loud and clear, by propon against gay right and against gay in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatr for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't chang the results). the major flaw in all thi postur is that in the end, the final effect of post like that of your and mr. hudson is that you have a \"conditional\" love for gays. condition: chang and we'll love you. thi is sure strang come from a group who claim that god ha an \"unconditional\" love, one that call peopl \"just as they are.\" sure there are thing that will 'naturally' change, and habit (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be chang through some sort of therapy. but then there are thing like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beat it out of people, is go to result in anyth more than an outward conforminti to \"other people' expectations.\" in the process thi coerc conform caus mani peopl a great deal of harm, especi when it is caus by peopl who have noth more to gain from it that to becom even more puf up about their own sens of pseuper-spirituality. thi is sad, but i thoroughli believ that one day it will change. it may be unpopular to cri for justic and equal when the basi ha to do with someth veri person like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but i firmli believ in the right of individu to be free from impos regul on thier bedrooms. it' funni that most straight peopl have success remov restrict and oppress legisl against invas legislation, but we like to maintain thi littl chestnut of repression...a though it help us maintain a sens of superior over at least one segment of society. gay peopl are not criminals. anoth interest thing happen recently. a veri promin charismat church in the silicon valley (here) had two of it' pastor arrest for self- admit charg of pederasti (men have sex with boys). thi had appar been go on for some time (a coupl years?), but sinc the charg were voluntary, and the church work close with the police, so i imagin that wa how they manag to downplay it in the media. how could such a thing happen when the church, itself, ha an ex-gay ministry? one of my friend recent told me he wa \"approached\" by someon who is go through the reparit therapi there, and he wa thoroughli convinc that the request for dinner wa not an invit to attend the ministry. these are difficult time we live in, but provid hostil environ and creat and perpetu an atmospher that breed hate and violenc is not the call of the christian community. the result of the pass amend in colorado ha creat an organ who' poster are appear all over colorado call \"s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t.\" (i forget the whole definit off hand, but the last part wa against immor gross homosexu trash) and their motto is \"work for a fag-fre america\" with an implicit advoc for violence. thi is sick, and it seem to be what you and mr. hudson, and other are embracing. we christian have a loooooooooong tradit of coersion and oppress toward those we feel don't 'measur up', and constant berat from organ like

if you will bear with me, i will attempt to explain thi appar inconsist from at least one christian' viewpoint: if god exist and is the creator of mankind as the bibl claims, then he ha a pretti well-defin concept of what make peopl tick physically, emotionally, etc. god ha an \"objective\" moral for us. that is to say, he ha no troubl understand what is good for (or detriment to) the creatur he created. galatian 2:10-- for we [mankind] are hi workmanship, creat in christ jesu for good work [a morality], which god prepar beforehand [a well-defin design], that we might walk in them. however, contrari to what mani peopl assum (includ the pharase of the bible,) god' moral cannot be complet codifi in a list of rule and regulations. to some extent, everi activ of a person' life creat a new situat to which moral must be applied. there never could be enough volum to codifi god' \"objective\" moral for us. throughout history, mankind ha tri to reduc moral to a list of rule (objectivity, if you please.) in the old testament, we have both principl and specif rules. by the time of jesus, most of the principl were obscur by the emphasi men had place on the rules. volum of addit rule had been made to tri to codifi the applic of the principles. we [mankind] weren't comfort with the \"subjectivity\" of principles. for refer see matthew 5 where jesu explain the differ between the law and the principl of the law. for example, in vers 21-22: \"you have heard that the ancient were told, 'you shall not commit murder'...and 'whoever commit murder shall be liabl to the court.' but i say to you that everyon who is angri with hi brother shall be liabl to the court...\" the \"object morality\" of god get blur by our inept interpret of it. we [christians] have made our biggest error when we have allow ani one person or group of peopl decid exactli what god intend for us. if we [christians] would stay commit to seek god' will instead of tri to prove we alreadi had it all figur out, we might do a better job of allow other to find god' \"object morality\" for themselves. if jesu is who he said he was/i (and that' the fundament question,) then he is \"object morality.\" john nunnal newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83621 from: dmcgee@uluhe.soest.hawaii.edu (don mcgee) subject: feder hear fact or rumor....?

and how doe one go about >love god? well, the whole *point* of make these the \"base\" command is that they *aren't* reduc to rules. a set of rule is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting. such thing can be veri help to individu or societi -- but not if they are use *instead* of a person involv in and respons for one' actions. the great command is, more than anyth else, a call to act *a if you were god and accept ultim responsibility* in your everi action. a demand that i, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keep pop up nonetheless (along with the reassur that it is more import that i be open to tri this, than succeed at it). \"conservatives\" may twist thi \"act as if you were god\" to mean \"lay down rule for other peopl and be as nasti to them as possibl if they don't keep your rules.\" they are so insist (and obvious) about thi that they have convinc a lot of peopl (who rightli reject the whole concept!) that such idioci is how god acts. that, after all, is the standard accus \"against god\" by the atheist here and elsewhere. that the \"conservatives\" have confus their manipulative, hoop-jump notion of coerc other peopl with the natur of god is almost the entir content of standard american atheism -- and i quit agre with it on thi point. >ethic system are not differenti by the nice sound goo >up front, much of which sound pretti much the same, but by the >*specific* acts, procedures, and argument that they recommend. and differ bodi of christian have, from the beginning, urg *different* \"ethic systems\" (or in some cases, none). as a result, it is bizarr to identifi ani one of these systems, howev popular (or infamous) with christianity. christian doe not have a torah. it doe not have a qu'ran. specif christian scriptur ha veri little, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so littl that the \"christians\" who desper *want* command go \"mining\" for them with almost no support (and thu almost no obviou limit :-)) for their efforts. the one, single, thing in the gospel which jesu specif \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\" [i will be expand on thi point in a repli to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quit true that some christian infer lot of command from the nt; i'll point out what ha to be go on in these inferences, and whi there is a huge amount of \"cultur baggage\" involved.] you are quit right that thi is \"goo\" if one is look for an ethic system. but whi should anyon be look for an ethic system, sinc our societi is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

(that is simpli the way god set thing up in the universes.) therefore, all those christian who worship jesus, and pray to jesus, and expect jesu to return and save them from their sins, are onli kid themselves, and have allow themselv to be dupe by a religion that wa mostli manufactur by the romans. and emot \"feelings\" are a total deceiv indic for religi validity. these thing are similarli true for follow of most other major world religions, includ islam. thirdly, the primari function of each master is to tune hi initi into the \"audibl life stream\" or \"sound current\", (refer to as \"the word\" in john 1:1-5, and as \"the river of life\" in revel 22:1), and to person guid each of them thru the upper level of heaven while they are still connect to their live physic bodi by a \"silver cord\". true salvation, which complet a soul' cycl of reincarn in the physic and psychic planes, is achiev onli by reach at least the \"soul plane\", which is five level or univers abov the physic universe, and thi cannot be done without the help of a physically-liv divin master. one such divin master aliv today is an american, sri harold klemp, the live \"eck\" master or \"mahanta\" for the \"eckankar\" organization, now headquart in minneapolis, (p.o. box 27300; zip 55427). anoth divin master is maharaj gurind singh ji, now live in punjab, india, and is associ with the \"sant mat\" organization. one of the classic book on thi subject is \"the path of the masters\" (radha soami books, p.o. box 242, gardena, ca 90247), written in 1939 by dr. julian johnson, a theologian and surgeon who spent the last year of hi life in india studi under and close observ the sant mat master of that time, maharaj sawan singh ji. sever of the eckankar books, includ some author by sri paul twitchel or sri harold klemp, can be found in most public and univers librari and some book stores, or obtain thru inter-librari loan. the book \"eckankar--th key to secret worlds\", by sri paul twitchell, is anoth classic. mani christian are like to confus the master with the \"anti-christ\", which is or wa to be a temporari world dictat dure the so-cal \"last days\". but the master don't ever rule, even when ask or expect to do so as jesu was. peopl who continu follow christianity, islam, or other orthodox religion with a physically-dead master, will continu on their cycl of reincarnation, between the psychic plane and thi miser physic world, until they final accept initi from a physically-liv divin master. re-incarn the book \"here and hereafter\", by ruth montgomery, describ sever kind of evid support reincarn as a fact of life, includ hypnot regress to past live [about 50% accurate; the subconsci mind sometim make thing up, especi with a bad hypnotist], spontan recal (especi by young children, some of whom can identifi their most recent previou relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), dream recal of past life experi- ences, deja vu (familiar with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read- ing of the late edgar cayce, and even support statement from the christian bibl includ matthew 17:11-13 (john the baptist wa the reincarn of elias.) and john 9:1-2 (how can a person possibl sin befor he is born, unless he live before?!). [ alway use the \"king jame version\". later version are per-versions! ] strong interests, innat talents, strong phobias, etc., typic origin from a person' past lives. for example, a strong fear of swim in or travel over water usual result from have drown at the end of a previou life. and sometim a person will take an immedi dislik to anoth person be met for the first time in thi life, becaus of a bad encount with him dure a previou incarnation. the teach of reincarn also includ the law of karma (galatian 6:7, revel 13:10, etc.). peopl would behav much better toward each other if they knew that their action in the present will sure be reap by them in the future, or in a futur incarnation! \"2nd comings\" if a divin master physic die (\"translates\") befor a particular initi of hi does, then when that initi physic die (\"translates\"), the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directli to the soul plane. thi is the one and onli correct mean of a 2nd coming. it is an individu experience, not someth that happen for everyon all at once. peopl who are still wait for jesus' \"2nd coming\" are wait in vain. plane of exist the physic univers is the lowest of at least a dozen major level of existence. abov the physic plane is the astral plane, the causal plane, the mental plane, the ether plane (often count as the upper part of the mental plane), the soul plane, and sever higher spiritu planes. the soul plane is the first true heaven, (count upward from the physical). the plane between (but not including) the physic and soul plane are call the psychic planes. it is like that esp, telepathy, astrolog influences, radion effects, biolog transmut [see the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without an appar physic origin, result from interact between the psychic plane and the physic plane. the major plane are also sub-divided. for example, a sub-plan of the astral plane is call \"hades\", and the christian hell occupi a small part of it, creat there less than 2000 year ago by the earli cathol church by some kind of black magic or by simpli teach it exist in a threaten manner. the christian \"heaven\" is locat elsewher on the astral plane. good christian will go there for a short while and then reincarn back to earth. sound current vs. blind faith the christian religion demand of it follow an extraordinari amount of blind faith back up by littl more than good feel (which is total deceiving). if a person is not hear some form of the \"sound current\" (\"the word\", \"the bani\", \"the audibl life stream\"), then hi cycl of reincarn in thi miser world will continue. the \"sound current\" manifest differ for differ initiates, and can sound like a rush wind, ocean wave on the sea shore, buzz bees, higher-pitch buzz sound, a flute, variou heavenli music, or other sounds. in eckankar, member start hear it near the end of their first year as a member. thi and other experi (such as \"soul travel\") replac blind faith. for more information, answer to your questions, etc., pleas consult my cite sourc (3 books, 2 addresses). un-alt reproduct and dissemin of thi import inform is encouraged. robert e. mcelwain 2nd initi in eckankar, (but not an agent thereof) newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83805 from: joshua@cpac.washington.edu (joshua geller) subject: re: rosicrucian order(s) ?! in articl <1qppef$i5b@usenet.ins.cwru.edu> ch981@cleveland.freenet.edu (toni alicea) writes: > kent: > you say that > >there are about 4-10 compet rosicrucian order exist today, ^^^^^^^^^ > >most of them are spin-off from oto and other compet organ > >from the 19th centuri france/germany. mayb i should write an articl > pleas don't! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ huh?

boyce, 1982). the term is probabl of median origin, given that herodotu mention the \"magoi\" as one of the six tribe of the medes. for a varieti of reason we can consid the magi to have been member of a priestli tribe of median origin in western iran. among the persians, they were respons for liturg functions, as well as for maintain their knowledg of the holi and the occult. most likely, the supremaci of the median priesthood in western iran becam establish dure the time of the median monarchi that domin the persian from the end of the eighth centuri through the first half of the sixth centuri bce until the revolt of cyru the great (550 bce). the persian were indebt to the mede for their polit and civil institut as well. even if hypothes have been advanc concern the exist of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period (boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of median origin. thi is demonstr by the eposid of the revolt of gaumata the magian, mention by dariu i (522-486 bce) in the inscript at bisutun (iran), as well as by greek sources. indeed, herodotu insist on the idea of the usurpatori power of the mede against the persian through the conspiraci of the magi. the fact that the magi may have been member of a tribe that hand down the sacerdot art in a hereditari fashion natur did not exclud the possibl that some of them undertook secular prefessions. thi seem to be attest by the elamit tablet at persepolis. there is a theses, put forth by giusepp messina, that deni that the magi are member of an ethnic group by suggest that they are simpli member of the priesthood - a priesthood of pure zoroastrian origin. thi thesi is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesi that their name is relat to the avestan term magavan, deriv from the gathic maga (vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is not without foundat (mole, 1963). the mean of maga can probabl be found, in conform with the pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separ of the \"mixture\" of the two oppos principl of spirit and matter. the maga, which ha been erron interpret as \"chorus,\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (nyberg, 1966) and ha been render simpli by an express like unio mystica, seem to be an ecstat condit that open the mind to spiritu vision. in ani case, though there may be a relat between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinct between the magi and the avestan priesthood. the avesta ignor the median or old persian term, despit a recent hypothesi propos by h.w. bailey; old persian inscript ignor the avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (vedic, athravan), even if thi is perhap present in an achaeminid set in the elamit tablet of persepoli (gershevitch, 1964). the term magu ha been present in zoroastrian throughout it history; the pahlavi term mogh-mard and mobad repres it continuation. the latter in particular deriv from an older form, magupati (\"head of the magi\"). dure the sasanid period (third to seventh centuri ce), which saw the format of a hierarch organ church, the titl mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of high priests\") came to be use to design the summit of the ecclesiast hierarchy. the magi practic consanguin marriage, or khvaetvadatha (av.; pahl., khwedodah). they also perform a characterist funer rite: the exposur of the corps to anim and vultur to remov the flesh and therebi cleans it. the corps wa not suppos to decompose, lest it be contamin by the demon of putrefaction. thi practic later becam typic of the entir zoroastrian commun and led to the rise of a complex funer ritual in iran and among the parsi in india. stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especi for thi rite. dure the time of herodotu the practic of exposur of the corps wa in vogu onli among the magi; the persian gener sprinkl the corps with wax, then buri it. the practic wa widespread, however, among the peopl of central asia. the magi were the technician of and expert on worship: it wa imposs to offer sacrific without the presenc of a magus. dure the perform of a ritual sacrifice, the magu sang of the theogoni (the magi were possibl the custodian of a tradit of sacr poetry, but we know noth about the relationship of thi tradit to the variou part of the avesta) and wa call upon to interpret dream and to divin the future. the magi were also known for the practic of kill harmful, or \"ahrimanical,\" anim (khrafstra) such as snake and ants. they dress in the median style, wear pants, tunics, and coat with sleeves. they wore a characterist head cover of felt (gr. tiara) with strip on the side that could be use to cover the nose and mouth dure ritual to avoid contamin consecr object with their breath (boyce, 1982). the color of these caps, in conform with a tradit that is probabl of indo-european origin, accord to georg dumezil, wa that of the priesthood: white. in all likelihood, dure the achaemenid period the magi were not in possess of a well-defin bodi of doctrine, and it is probabl that they gradual adopt zoroastrianism; they were most like a clergi consist of profession priest who were not tie to a rigid orthodoxi but were natur inclin to eclectic and syncretism. nonetheless, they must have been jealou guardian of the patrimoni of zorastrian traditions. by virtu of thi they were the educ of the royal princes. the wisest of them wa respons for teach the princ the \"magic of zarathushtra, son of horomazes\" and thu the \"cult of the gods.\" magi who excel in other virtu were entrust with the educ of the princ so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself. dure the achaemenid period the magi maintain a posit of great influence, although they were certainli subordin to the emperor. despit sever dramat event such as the massacr they suffer after the death of gaumata the magian - in which, accord to herodotu (who call himself smerdis), the persian kill a larg number of magi to aveng the usurp - the magi nevertheless manag to maintain their influenc at court in media, in persia, and in the variou region of the empir where they were station as a consequ of the persian civilian and militari administration. no priesthood of antiqu wa more famou than that of the magi. they were renown as follow of zarathushtra (zoroaster); as the teacher of some of the greatest greek thinker (pythagoras, democritus, plato); as the wise men who arrived, guid by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem; and as the propag of a cult of the sun in india. but they were also known as the chaldeans, the priesthood of babylon, known for it occultism; thi wa perhap the reason that the term mago had a pejor sens in greek, like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (bidez and cumont, 1938). indeed, the chaldean were expert in all type of magic arts, especi astrology, and had a reput for wisdom as well as knowledge. to understand the reason for such variou and sometim discord views, it is necessari to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-cal western magi, who were later hellenized. in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian, but the western magi (those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor, syria, mesopotamia, and armenia), who came in contact with divers religi traditions, must have, sooner or later and in vari degrees, been influenc by syncret concepts. the greek were familiar with both kind of magi and, depend on their vari concerns, would emphas one or the other aspect of them. classic historian and geographers, includ herodotu and strabo, document their customs, while the philosoph dwell abov all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, magian cosmolog and cosmogony, and their theolog and eschatology. those sourc most interest in the doctrin of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus. in do so they are repeat what the magi themselv said from the median and achaemenid periods, when they adopt zoroastrianism. at that time they embrac zarathushtra as one of their own and place themselv under hi vener name. zoroastrian had alreadi undergon sever profound transform in the eastern commun by the time of the acheamenid and wa alreadi adapt those element of the archaic religion that refus to die. it ha been said quit often, in an attempt to character the precis role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition, that the vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjur daivas\"), part of the avesta, should be attribut to them. (thi collect of text from variou period is primarili concern with purificatori rule and practices.) nonetheless, the hypothesi is hardli plausible, sinc the first chapter of the vendidad - a list of sixteen land creat by ahura mazda, the suprem god of zoroastrianism, but contamin by an attack by ahriman (pahl.; gathic-avestan, angra mainyu), the other suprem god and the ultim sourc of all evil and suffer - doe not mention western iran, persia, or media (the land of ragha mention in the text cannot be median raghiana). furthermore, it ha been note (gershevitch, 1964) that if the author had been magi the absenc of ani refer to western iranian institutions, includ their own priesthood, would be veri strange. the magi were abov all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradit and the corpu of the avesta have been transmit to us, from the second half of the first millennium bce on. thi ha been their princip merit. we can attribut directli to the magi the new formul that iranian dualism assumed, known to us especi from greek sourc and, in part, from the pahlavi literatur of the ninth and tenth centuri ce. accord to thi formulation, the two pole of the dualism are no longer, as in the gathas, spenta mainyu (\"benefic spirit\") and angra mainyu (\"hostil spirit\") but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu (gershevitch, 1964). [see ahura mazda and angra mainyu.] thi trans- format wa of immens consequ for the histor develop of zoro- astrian and wa most like determin by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religi world. in thi new dualism - which wa that later known to the greek (aristotle, eudemu of rhodes, theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirm of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism, to which we give the name zurvanism. [see zurvanism.] thank to their adher to zoroastrianism, the magi play an enorm import role in the transmiss of zarathushtra' treachings, as well as in the definit of the new form that these would assum historically. their natur propens to eclectic and syncret also help the diffus of zoroastrian idea in the commun of the iranian diaspora. the greek began to studi their doctrin and to take an interest in them (xanthu of lydia, hermodorus, aristotle, theopompus, hermippus, dinon), even write treatis on the persian religion, of which onli the titl and a few fragment have survived. in the hellenist period, the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and write on magic, astrology, and alchemi were lent the author of such prestigi name as zarathushtra, ostanes, and hystaspes, form an abund apocryph literature. (bidez and cumont, 1938). later still, eschatolog and apocalypt were a fertil meet ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions, as can be seen in the famou _oracl of hystaspes_, a work whose iranian root are undeni and which most like date from the begin of the christian era, probabl the second centuri ce (widengren, 1968). the zoroastrian doctrin of the savior of the futur (saoshyant) wa the basi for the stori of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ (2:1-12). [see saoshyant.] the sasanid period saw the magi onc again play a determin role in the religi histori of iran. concern to win back the western magi (de menasce, 1956), and eager to consolid zoroastrian as the nation religion of iran, the priest of iranian sanctuari in media and persia were abl to establish a true state church, strongli hierarch and endow with an orthodoxi base on the format of a canon of scriptures. the lead figur in the develop of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxi were tosar and kerder, the persecutor of mani in the third century. saoshyant: the avestan term saoshyant (\"futur benefactor\"; mpers., soshans) design the savior of the world, who will arriv at a futur time to redeem humankind. the concept of the futur savior is one of the fundament notion of zoro- astrianism, togeth with that of dualism; it appear as earli as in the gathas. zarathushtra (zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a sao- shyant, one who perform hi work for the frashokereti, the end of the present state of the world, when exist will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\" [see frashokereti] later zoroastrian doctrin develop thi notion into a true eschatolog myth and expand the number of saoshyant from one to three. all the savior are born from the seed of zarathushtra, which is preserv through the age in lake kansaoya (identifi with present-day lake helmand, in seistan, iran), protect by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. the greatest of the await saoshyants, the victori astvatereta (\"he who embodi truth\"), the son of the vispataurvairi (\"she who conquer all\"), is the third, who will make exist splendid; he appear in yasht 19. upon hi arriv humankind will no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be grant unlimit power. at that time the dead will be resurrected, and the live will be immort and indestructable. brandish the weapon with which he kill the power enemi of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and of asha), astvatereta will look upon the whole of corpor exist and render it imperishable. he and hi comrad will engag in a great battl with the forc of evil, which will be destroyed. the name astvatereta is clearli the result of theolog specul (kellens, 1974), as are those of hi two brothers, ukhshyatereta, \"he who make truth grow,\" and ukhshyatnemah, \"he who make rever grow\"; the name of the three virgin (yasht 13) who are impregn with the seed of zarathushtra when they bath in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants, are equal speculative. each of these saoshyant will arriv at the begin of a millennium, initi a new age and a new cycl of existence; astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind. the doctrin of the futur savior had alreadi taken shape in the archaemenid period (sixth to fourth centuri bce). it wa not, perhap the princip element in the format of the messian idea, but it wa certainli a determin factor, one that enjoy great success in the hellenist period beyond the confin of the iranian world. a similar concept, that of the futur buddha, maitreya, wa most like indebt to it, and christian messian can trace it root to the same source. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 83818 from: pharvey@quack.kfu.com (paul harvey) subject: re: clarif of person posit in articl <c5rbht.fw4@athena.cs.uga.edu> hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (paul hudson jr) writes: >in articl <c5muiw.aqc@mailer.cc.fsu.edu> dlecoint@garnet.acns.fsu.edu (darius_lecointe) writes: >>if it were a sin to violat sunday no one could >>ever be forgiven for that for jesu never kept sunday holy. he onli >>recogn one day of the seven as holy. >jesu also recogn other holi days, like the passover. act 15 say >that no more should be lay on the gentil than that which is necessary. >the sabbath is not in the list, nor do ani of the epistl instruct peopl >to keep the 7th day, while christian were live among peopl who did not >keep the 7th day. it look like that would have been a problem. >instead, we have scriptur tell us that all day can be esteem alik >(roman 14:5) and that no man should judg us in regard to what kind of >food we eat, jewish holi day we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath.

have you ever lie to someone? even a littl white lie? have you ever claim to know someth that you realli didn't know? have you ever hate someone? have you ever been selfish? are you guilti of ani one of these? the answer is of course, yes. you are guilty. period. that is it what jesu is get at. no big surprise. feel do not even enter the picture. consid jesus' use of the word \"guilt\" as how a court use it. jesu is concern that everyon should admit that they are guilti of be imperfect. the bibl call it the state that we are all sinners. we all do bad things. even the most insignfic thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners. it is it in our natur to do bad things. we are sinners, therefor we do bad things. be a sinner is fact. it is not a pleasant fact. but it is just a fact. we are not perfect. call us sinner should have no more emot charg to you than call you a human being. guilti as charged. > and then there' thi singl person that will save you from thi > univers guilt feeling. you can handl your guilt in one of two ways: acknowledg you made a mistake, learn from it, and tri to not do it again--in the meantime, not punish yourself for it: which is the way jesu want you to handl or it. thi is the healthi way. or two, the destruct way: put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgiv yourself, forc yourself to say a thousand hail mari . . . even to suicide. thi the way jesu doe not want us to deal with it. all peopl fall into thi categori to some extent in their lives. jesu is not in the busi of save us from thi guilt feeling. jesu is in the busi of show us how much he love us despit our guilt. jesu know we are guilty. that isn't new to him. it is no big deal to him. he just want you to realiz that thi sin natur destroy the relationship between you and him. that is what he want you to know. why, becaus he want to have your company. you are immens valuabl to him. jesu want a relationship with you, however, in our present sin nature, we are incap of have thi relationship. god is perfect. we are not. you cannot fit a squar peg into a round hole. however, god ha provid a way for us to chang our natur so that we can have a relationship with him. god ha provid jesus, so that whosoev just believ in jesus, will have their natur changed. the holi spirit will move it. and now divin natur is now within live our veri being--and us and god commun with each through hi unifi holi spirit. the benefit of thi are endless. for with the divin natur live within us, we can now see our imperfect better. we can now head them off at the pass. with the power of the holi spirit live in us, we now have hi power to help us overcom our shortcomings. becaus the divin natur live within us, we can now understand profound bibl passag that never befor we could understand. becaus the divin natur now live within us, we now have author over demon forces. and lastly, becaus the divin natur now live within us, we have etern life--for the holi spirit is eternal. the relationship with jesu is of the utmost importance. becaus it is not what you do in life that qualifi you to belong to heavenli kingdom, it is your relationship to the live god. rememb what jesu said at the tail end of matthew when he separ the \"goat from the sheep\". mani peopl in the last day will ask him, \"didn't i prophesi in your name and do miracles, and do good thing in your name?\" and what did jesu say? \"depart from me, for i never *knew* you.\" that is the cornerston of christianity, kent. jesu must know you as hi friend. it is your relationship to jesus. if he is your friend and you are his, you will be count among those who will share in hi inherit in heaven. > brian, i will tell you a secret, i don't feel guilti at all, > i do mistakes, and i regret them, howev i'v never had thi > huge guilt feel hang over my shoulder. good. it show that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself. that is the second greatest command jesu taught. if onli more peopl could do as you do. as i said before, in the common english venacular, \"feel guilty\" ha a differ mean than the state of guilt. > thi all is a veri clear indic that you need a certain > person type in order to believ and adjust to certain > religi doctrines. and if your person type is > opposite, then you are not that easili attach to a certain > world view system. i believ what we all need in our person is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more uncondit love. > there are human that subscrib to the same notion. the nice > thing is that when you final shake off thi huge burden, > the shoulder feel far more relaxed! yes. you have state what jesu said. remember?

\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" thi is get a bit silli and the word \"objective\" is lose all meaning. let start by rememb the definit of \"objective\" which ha been alreadi presented: object adj. 1. of or have to do with a materi object as distinguish from a mental concept. 2. have actual existence. 3.a. unenfluenc by emot or person prejudice. b. base on observ phenomenon. the object of a thing is not base on whether everyon agre on that thing (eg: the world is object round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is base observ and verifi phenomenon (instead of be base sole on peopl wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). thu atoms, be base on veri observ and repeat phenomenon, are inde consid to be object rather than subjective. even weird, high energi physic is base on observ phenomenon (even though that observ can chang the outcome). nor are those observ phenomenon affect by emotion, or person prejudic (eg: chemic reaction do not chang to the whim of differ people). thu to say that scienc is not object (ie: object verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science. now i will agre that scienc is not object \"good;\" i will not therebi conclud though that scienc is not objective. now some exampl thing which are \"objective\": a d-12 tractor is larger than the averag breadbox. chlorophyl is green. seawat contain salt. there exist ozon in the atmospher (at least presently). ozon block ultraviolet light. ultraviolet light increas the incid of skin cancer. \"good\" on the other hand is a valu judgement. it doesn't seem to have an exist apart from what we give it (unless someon can object show the exist of an omnipot entiti which ha defin \"good\"). we cannot quantifi it, touch it or collect it in ani concret sens (eg: i have a bag full of \"good\"). now we do sometim attempt to give the word \"good\" an object meaning, e.g. \"good\" ha been use to denot strength, resiliency, speed, etc. that though, is a subject definition, as some might not see \"strength\" and etc, as necessarili \"good\" (eg: strength inspir by naziism is not gener view as \"good\"). as to a morality, i cannot say that i have ever seen a moral strictli base on verifi observ phenomenon. the closest i have seen is some form of the \"golden rule,\" which conclud that it is best not to deliber piss peopl off, as they will like then involv themselv in your life, in a manner you won't like. thi is verifiable; when you \"get in someone' face,\" they will often retaliate. anoth object fact about moral is that a more power group can enforc their moral on a weaker group, and thu can at times, ignor that form of the \"golden rule\" without fear of reprisal. now as to whether thi enforc of moral is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quit subjective. by the way, rememb that subject doe not mean that a thing cannot be formal stated, or even commonli agre upon; it onli mean that that it is not verifi from observ phenomena, or ha a physic exist unto itself. also note that i have not state that there is no such thing as an object morality, or that i could not accept ani such a morality; i have simpli state that i have seen no evid of ani such morality. one other thing to notice, \"objective\" is mani time use as synonym with \"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometim ha the connot of \"false\" and/or \"relative.\" tain't necessarili so. for instance, when a conclus is base on objective, but insuffici evidence, then it can be both object and false. as to \"absolute,\" it is easi to note that while we can object show that tnt is explosive, but that doe not absolut mean that all tnt will explode, and thu object is not necessarili absolut either. on the other hand, someth subject can also be either \"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" for instance, there are some theist who are specif \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have onli subject evid to back it up. further, mani a scientist and detect ha been motiv by subject reason (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to investig a phenomena or situation, and gather the object evid necessari to support a true hypothesis. on the whole though, i would have to agre that object evid is much more trustworthi than subject evidence. later, dave butler in start ani thesis, it seem to me, one should put

second, they didn't care. they want a confrontation. they want public and they got it. after the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming. they also said it would have been foolish to go in know that. well, we know now that they intercept the inform call and went in anyway. did they explor all of the possibl for end the seige? accord to them they did, but accord to the hartford courant, the woman that rais koresh (hi grandmother) wa not allow to go in and see him. the fbi agent who she spoke with wa bob rick and accord to the paper he said: \"a lot of peopl think if you just talk to them logic they will come out. hi grandmoth rais vernon howell; (koresh' real name) she didn't rais david koresh.\" someon who rais you and love you doe not speak to you strickli on a logic level. there is also an emot level on which they can reach you. here' anoth one. all dure thi oper the fbi ha been claim that they fear a mass suicid and that is one of the reason that someth must be done. now they claim they never thought he would do it? i knew they were go to do someth when they start talk about how much money thi wa costing. that wa the start of the \"justification\" part part of the plan. that' when i knew it would come soon. but, back to the plan. it is consid \"cruel and unus punishment\" to execut crimin in the mind of mani people, but look at what' acceptable. they knew the parent (adults) had ga masks. they did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them. so the plan wa to pour the ga into the compound. the mothers, see what the ga wa do to their children were suppos to run out and that would onli leav the men to deal with. i spent two year in the armi and like everyoth veteran i went through cbr (chemical, biolog radiological) warfar training. part of that train is go into a room fill with the same stuff that the children were subject to. to make the stuff realli interest the ga also ha a chemic agent that irrit the skin. you think it on fire. i have no doubt the children would becom hysterical. it not the kind of thing you never want to do again. thi wa the plan, the final solution. we wait 444 day for our hostag to come home from iran. we gave these peopl 51 days. i state on sever occas that there wa absolut noth in thi whole thing that the govern could point to as a success. well, fbi agent rick chang my mind. again a newclip from the hartford courant: \"and while express regret at the loss of life, he suggest that the oper had been at least a modifi success becaus not a singl feder shot had been fire and not a singl feder agent had been hurt.\" it took 17 dead children to get us that new definit of success. one more thought. the govern claim that they believ he had automat weapon on the premises. he had a licens for the 50 calib machin gun! they knew damn well he had one. they also knew he had it legally! still, without the element of surpris they sent in agent to get him. for all of thi my presid take full responsibility. what a guy! i hope he get it. in articl <exuptr.1431.0@exu.ericsson.se>, exuptr@exu.ericsson.s (patrick taylor, the sound board) writes: > in articl <11974@prijat.cs.uofs.edu> bill@triangle.cs.uofs.edu (bill gunshannon) writes: > >>befor you go absolv the batf & fbi of all blame in thi incident, you should >>probabl be awar of two import facts. >>1. there is no such thing as non-tox tear gas. tear ga is non-breath >> remain in it' presenc will caus nausea and vomiting, follow eventu >> by siezur and death. did the fbi know the physic health of all the peopl >> they exposed??

[ if ani of my protest inquisitor would *like* to turn the discuss to the author of tradition, i can accomod them :-), unlik *most* protestants, episcopalian admit claim from a) scriptur b) reason and c) tradit on roughli equal standing. ] earlier in john than my quot above, we read [john 13:34] \"i give you a new commandment: love one another.\" thi is the onli place in the nt where christian are given an explicit commandment, with the context comment on it imper mode pronounc by jesus. at the same meal [so we *readers* infer, sinc it is *not* in john, but in the synoptics] jesu says, \"take thi [bread]; thi is my body.\" [mark 14:22, cf. matthew 26:26, luke 22:19, 1 corinthian 11:24] the mode is imper (greek _labete_), and henc this, too, is a \"commandment.\" in *both* case we have to *infer* that the command is direct to a wider circl than the immedi colloc of discipl -- becaus we judg the evangelist' point in mention it (with the discipl by then mostli or entir dead) is that *we* are expect to follow thi as a command from our lord. in the case of communion, paul' mention (at least; thi is probabl true of the evangelist also) impli an ongo ritual liturgi in which these word oper to \"bind\" christian to the origin command to hi disciples, as a continu command to the christian community. i am entir comfort with thi inference, but i *must* point out that it is there, between us and the occas on which jesu spoke the command. i take it as a clear inference, at the veri least the evangelist' notion, that *all* christian are call to love one another, in jesus' command direct at the disciples. but i have to call attent to the inference. the command cannot appli to me without the gener from the specif context of it statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of christ. all read of scriptur ha to make such inferences, to get ani sens out of the text whatsoever. thi is a gener problem in read these text -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understand of our nativ languag in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreci of the origin context (and at points, the origin languages, when english mislead us.) i am go to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scriptur under control [ i don't *really* think thi is true, but it will suffic for my current purposes. ] i will address onli the issu that aris when we have alreadi cope with the understand of a 2000 year old text from anoth world than the one we live in. question at that level onli introduc more reser- vation about the command issu than will be found stipul that we can read the text as the origin audienc might have done. among the reason we have for see john' _agap allelou_ as a *general* command (not mere an instruct by jesu to thi discipl on that one occasion), and one link it to the synopt \"great commandment\" is that we have criticism, from jesus, about limit our love to those whom we congeni associ with. in matthew 5:43ff we read, \"you have learnt how it wa said: 'you must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. but i say to you: love your enemies.\" in fact, the leviticu context quot doe not say 'hate your enemy' -- it is mere the common human presumption. (and leviticu is at pain to say that the \"love\" should extend to stranger amongst the peopl of israel.) luke, in expand on thi same q context, goe on to have jesu say. \"even sinner love those who love them.\" [6:27] all of thi suggest [quit strongly, i'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the \"new commandment\" is not quit what jesu ha in mind. in short, infer *lead me* to gener the actual text to a command that is \"in force\" on christians, and with object not limit to other christians. trickier than the _agap allelou_ or institut of communion, there is the case of the \"great commission\" where (matthew 10, mark 6) the twelv are sent out to evangelize, \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.\" the verb is imper (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specif to the twelve, and there are further specifi (a in \"do not turn your step to pagan territory, and do not enter ani samaritan town\" -- the lukan parallel are even more specif to jesus' final journey to jerusalem) which make it harder to see thi gener to all christian than the previou examples. that hasn't prevent christian from make such an inference; what i have to call attent to is that such infer is not justifi in the text, nor (unlik the first two case i cite) by the rhetor of the evangelist urg on the reader. still, paul seem to have felt oblig to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\" even (contrari to jesus' instruct to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the end of the earth. so, christian after him have also taken thi as a \"commandment\" in the sens of john 14:15. do i \"accept\" this? i don't know. it is sure rather speculative. but you see how the rippl of infer spread out from the text that is the pretext -- christian (may) infer a gener commandment, applic to all, from what is present in the gospel as a specif occasion. i do not (necessarily) object to thi kind of gener -- but i *insist* that peopl who make it *must* have an understand that they are *reasoning* (at some consider length) from what we actual *have* in scripture. there are *assumptions* involv in thi reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselv scriptur (though peopl will do their best to \"justify\" their assumpt by other refer to scriptur -- which simpli add more infer into the mix!) let' move on to the \"great commandment\" -- that we should love god with our whole heart and mind and souls. thi is, perhaps, the synopt \"equivalent\" of john' _agap allelou_. and yet, it is not present as a commandment, in our texts. rather, the context is controversi with the pharisees. to cite matthew [22:34ff] \"but when the pharise heard that he had silenc the sadduce they got togeth and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, \"master, which is the greatest command of the law?\" it is by no mean obviou here (though i accept it as such) that jesus' answer is meant to be a command *to christians*. he is answer a polem from hi enemies. [ mark' account, in 12:28-34 cast the answer in a far more posit light as (so the \"scribe\" in thi version says) \"far more import than ani holocaust (i need to point out that thi word origin in the context of anim sacrifice; forget the nazi for this) or sacrifice.\" luke is intermedi -- he ha a lawyer pose the question \"to disconcert\" jesus, and get the good samarian parabl for hi pain [ luke 10:25-37 ]. the context here are so confusingli variou that one could be forgiven for draw *no* infer :-) in *no* account is thi said as if it were obvious to be taken as a command bind on christian -- though i think it an entir reason conclus in each case that jesu think it to be so. the point is that our mental gear have to grind a cycl or so to get to ani conclus from all of thi about what we are command to do, by jesus. and all of thi is conting on our understand the point of jesus' use of the torah in the (all quit different) gospel accounts, and the applic of such a context to *us*. the differ context among the synopt are curious. it should be note that onli in luke do we get the \"fixing\" of thi command by the parabl of the good samaritan. we may look for an analog *intent* in matthew, where 7:12 give the \"golden rule\" as \"the mean of the law and the prophets\" (and where we may also hear an echo of hillel say the same, a gener befor jesus.) if we make these associ (which i think are entir reasonable), we are -- again -- indulg in inference. the text do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the text as have thi kind of inter-relationship. current literari theori call thi \"intertextuality.\" my discuss of whi the _agap allelou_ \"has\" to appli beyond the commun of the disciples, and beyound the circl of christian believers, appli again here, to buttress a conclus that thi *is* (despit the present not say so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to christians. few christian would disagre with my conclus -- but i *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elabor chain of reason that are simpli not present in the texts, themselves. the contextu problem keep come up, more and more sever as we look at those say of jesu that are not so univers taken by christian as commandments. and we get some realli hard cases. take divorce. mark is pretti clear, \"the man who divorc hi wife and marri anoth is guilti of adulteri against her.\" [ 10:11, cf. luke 16:18 ] -- except that matthew ha an escap claus [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. thi seem to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take matthew' reservation); and some christians, to thi day, take it so. but some don't, at least in practice. thi is rather peculiar; it is not as if jesu were not explicit about thi (wherea he say noth at all about some of the thing peopl gnash their teeth over.) how is it possible, if the command of christ are clear, that matthew can so disagre with the other evangelist of the synopt tradition? i'm go to continu thi examination, into ever-murki waters, but thi is enough to start with. the theme is: \"find command in scriptur is an exercis in inference; our infer are inform by our assumptions, that is, our own cultur biases.\" i have, so far, identifi a veri few \"commandments\" that are gener accept by all christian -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulti start to surface. it is these difficulti i want to discuss in my next essay on thi topic. the divorc command alreadi strike at some of the difficulties: i see almost no evid that the peopl who are so eager to find command to condemn *me* with, spend ani time at all write nasti screed to soc.coupl or misc.leg about the horror or vicious of divorce, or demand that us law refus to allow it, or refus \"unrepent divorcees\" place in their churches. [ that is not to say that divorc *doesn't* enter into consider in gener -- it is most definit a matter of concern, in even the most \"liberal\" church circles. for example, a (wildly) liber episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liber diocese, ha recommend to a coupl who approach him to marri them that they have a \"private\" secular ceremoni befor a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremoni he celebr need not go through an agon \"examination\" by offici who would just as soon not take on thi role of interpret the command we are face with as christians. this, in a church that wa effect creat by a famou divorce! ] -- michael l. siemon i say \"you are gods, son of the mls@panix.com most high, all of you; nevertheless - or - you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com like ani prince.\" psalm 82:6-7 newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84136 from: mls@panix.com (michael siemon) subject: re: what part of \"no\" don't you understand?

who did koresh emulate? who wa koresh' teacher? koresh did to hi follow what satan did to eve. did not koresh kill hi followersr? did not satan caus adam and eve to die as well? did not the cult follow believ koresh even though they knew the real christ wa born in bethlehem? did not eve choos to eat from the tree of the knowledg of good and evil despit know that it would caus her death? god held them all responsible--deceiv and the rebeller. none of them had an excuse. as oppos to the branch davidians, we have a second chance. follow jesu and he will escort us to the path of etern life. don't follow jesus, and you stand condemn already, for like the branch davidian complex, your hous is alreadi on fire. satan, adam and eve have alreadi set it ablaze. it is just a slow burn, but it is burn nevertheless. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84143 from: an030@cleveland.freenet.edu (broward horne) subject: re: a messag for you mr. president: how do you know what happened?

annapoli may not be new york, but it' at least a two-hors town. but suppos 22,000 peopl is a \"small town\" -- it' still 22,000 peopl more than ezekiel predicted. and you'v said noth about the other problem. in chapter 26, ezekiel predict that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuables. however, nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre, and in chapter 29 ezekiel even quot god as say \"he and hi armi got no reward from the campaign he led against tyre.\" let' ignor alexand for a moment, and just pay attent to chapter 26. ezekiel say n. would destroy tyre, and n. did not destroy tyre. ezekiel say that n. would plunder their valuables, but n. did not plunder their valuables. regardless of what you think about tyre _now_, the fact is that n. die befor the place wa destroyed. ezekiel said n. wa go to do it, and n. did not. * thi post is, of course, pointless. inerrantist have an amaz abil to rewrit the bibl as need to fit whatev they want it to say. for example, i expect mr king to respond to the comment about ezekiel 26 by pull some \"clear implications\" out of hat. when ezekiel said that n. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearli impli that the wall would still be stand so peopl would know where the tower use to be. and when ezekiel said that n. would \"demolish your fine hous and throw your stones, timber and rubbl into the sea\", that clearli impli that n. would never set foot on the island. and when ezekiel wrote that n. would \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearli impli that n. would spend 13 year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the walls. see?

what is the sourc of thi pseudo-doctrine? who is > the pseudo-teacher? who is the great deceiver? ok, here' at least one christian' answer: jesu wa a jew, not a christian. in thi context matthew 5:14-19 make sense. matt 5:17 \"do not think that i [jesus] came to abolish the law or the prophets; i did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\" jesu live under the jewish law. however, he wa the culmin of the promis of the prophets. he came to *fulfill* the propheci and fulli obey god' purposes. vers 18 say \"for truli i say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished.\" the key to thi vers imho is the last phrase. jesus, as the fulfil of the law, \"accomplished\" what the law wa suppos to accomplish. vers 19: \"whoever then annul one of the least of these commandments, and so teach others, shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keep and teach them, he shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven.\" taken in the context of jesu teach jewish peopl about live live under the law, thi make sense. in general, it appear that jesu is respond to some critic he must have receiv about \"do away with the law.\" that wa not jesus' intent at all. he had come to earth to live the law as it should be live and fulfil the promis made by god to hi peopl all the way back to eve [gen 3:15-the serpent will bruis your heel, but *he* will bruis hi head.] jesu appear to be \"do away with the law\" becaus he did not honor the tradit of men as equal to the law of god. he regularli lock horn with the religi leader of the day becaus he would not conform to *their* rules, onli god' law. in the matthew passag jesu is defend hi dedic to the law and defend himself against hi accusors. almost the entir sermon on the mount (matt. 5-7) is dedic to help the jewish peopl understand the true intent of the law, sweep away the clutter which had been introduc by the pharase and their traditions. in galatian 3:23-26, paul describ the relationship of jesu to the law in thi way: [23] but befor faith came, we were kept in custodi under the law, be shut up to the faith which wa later to be revealed. [24] therefor the law ha becom our tutor to lead us to christ, that we may be justifi by faith. [25] but now that faith ha come, we are no longer under a tutor. [26] for you are all son of god through faith in christ jesus. i believ thi say that after christ wa revealed, the law had serv it' purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to christ,\" and now, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\" the law ha been \"fulfilled\" as christ said he would do. god, the author of the old law, and the christ/man, jesus, are the same personality. therefore, the old law and the new testament (the \"last will and testament\" of jesus) are base on the same moral principles. it make sens that mani of the principl in the old law are re-express in christianity. on the other hand, now that the law ha fulfil it' purpos and christian relat to god through christ, not the law, it also make sens that new practic and new symbol were establish to repres the \"mysteries\" of thi new relationship. i.e. baptism repres christ' death, burial, and resurrect (rom. 6:3-8), the lord' supper as a memori to hi sacrific (i cor. 11:26), and sunday as a day of worship commemor hi resurrect (matt 28:1ff, act 20:7) ok, that' one christian' explanation. i don't claim to have all these issu complet settl even in my own mind and i welcom other christian to offer other alternatives. pleas excus the long posting. thank for your interest if you have read thi far... john nunnal nunnally@acs.harding.edu newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84196 subject: re: alt.sex.stori under literari critic anali from: nunnally@acs.harding.edu (john nunnally) in <sandvik-170493170457@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com writes: > in articl <1qevbh$h7v@agate.berkeley.edu>, dzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu (denni > kriz) wrote: > > i'm go to tri to do someth here, that perhap mani would > > not have thought even possible. i want to begin the process of > > initi a literari critic studi of the pornographi post on > > alt.sex.stories, to identifi the major theme and motif present > > in the stori post there -- open up then the possibl of > > an object moral evalu of the materi present there. > > dennis, i'm astounded. i didn't know you were interest to even > studi such filth as alt.sex.stori provide... > > cheers, > kent > --- > sandvik@newton.apple.com. alink: ksand -- privat activ on the net. \"finally, brethern, whatev is true, whatev is honorable, whatev is right, whatev is pure, whatev is lovely, whatev is of good repute, if there is ani excel and if anyth worthi of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.\" phil. 4:8. more cheers, john nunnally@acs.harding.edu newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84197 from: royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (roy crabtree) subject: re: that kill by sword, must be kill by sword in articl <sandvik-210493014635@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes: >in articl <c5tcz8.4z9@rbdc.wsnc.org>, royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (roy crabtree) >wrote: >> in articl <20apr199306173611@utarlg.uta.edu> b645zaw@utarlg.uta.edu (stephen) writes: >> >in articl <sandvik-190493201048@sandvik-kent.apple.com>, >> >sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes... >> ... >> >>so are you happi now when 70+ people, includ innoc kids, >> >>di today?

it usual all ha to do with how the child is brought up. from the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the bible, the torah, the qur'an, & etc. he is told of thi wondrou god who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophet talk about in the scripture, of the miracl performed, & etc. he is also told that to question thi (a children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against god, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture' truth is to damn one' soul to hell. thus, by the time he is abl to read the scriptur for himself, the belief in it \"truth\" is so ingrain in hi mind it all seem a matter of course. but it doesn't stop there. onc the child is abl to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculc the child the \"right\" read of scripture, to concentr more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the wors ones, and to explain away the unexplain with \"mystery.\" circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" fact and \"truths,\" unreason belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of everi day. to doubt, of course, mean wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away hi brain when the matter concern god. all of thi ha some consider effect on the child, so that when he becom an adult, the superstit he' been taught are nearli imposs to remove. all of thi lead me to ask whether the theist can truli be object when question god, hell, heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. can he, for a moment, put asid thi notion that god *does* exist and look at everyth from a unbias point of view?

if christ himself wa not in heaven until sunday, how could the repent thief have been there with him? the answer lie in the locat of \"paradise\" when jesu died. appar paradis wa not exalt to heaven until easter day. jesu refer to it in the middl of the stori of the rich man and lazaru as \"abraham' bosom,\" to which the godli beggar lazaru wa carri by the angel after hi deceas (luke 16:19-31). thu \"abraham' bosom\" refer to the place where the soul of the redeem wait till the day of christ' resurrection. it wa not yet lift to heaven but it may well have been a section of hade (hebrew: sheol), reserv for believ who had die in the faith but would not be admit into the gloriou presenc of god in heaven until the price of redempt had actual been paid on calvary; or even that none would preced the presenc of jesu back to glori with the father. doubtless it wa the infern paradis that the soul of jesu and the repent thief repair after they each die on friday afternoon. but on sunday, after the risen christ had first appear to mari magdalen (john 20:17) and her two companion (matthew 28:9), presum he then took up with him to glori all the inhabit of infern paradis (includ abraham, lazarus, and the repent thief). we read in ephesian 4:8 concern christ: \"ascend on high, he led captiv captive; he gave gift unto men.\" vers 9 continues: \"but what doe `he ascended' mean but that he also descend to the lowest part of the earth?\" -i.e., to hades. vers 10 adds: \"he who descend is the same as he who ascend abov all the heavens.\" presum he led the whole band of liber captiv from hade (i.e., the whole popul of preresurrect paradise) up to the glori of heaven. ra> whenev your person interpret of biblic passag is ra> challenged, your onli respons seem to be that one need mere to ra> \"look at the bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see biblic thing differ from you?

(promis messiah, p. 100) notic that mcconki said the christian are as wrong about their \"three-in-on god\" and their belief that \"god is a spirit\" as they are in their understand of who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are. befor examin mcconkie' attack and it validity, we shall read a few more statement by mcconki and other mormon sourc concern the word \"elohim\" and \"jehovah.\" mcconki stated: \"...the chief design of christ that ha been preserv for us in the old testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the exalt name-titl jehovah. (promis messiah, p. 367) \"_elohim_, plural word though it is, is also use as the exalt name-titl of god the etern father, a usag that connot hi supremaci and omnipotence, he be god abov all gods. (mormon doctrine, p. 224) agre with mcconki on the question of who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are, the apostl jame e. talmag stated: \"_elohim_, as understood and use in the restor church of jesu christ, is the name-titl of god the etern father, whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_ -- the onli begotten in the flesh, jesu christ. (jesu the christ, p. 38) \"a doctrin exposit by the first presid and the twelve\" apostl of the mormon church state that \"god the etern father...[is] designate[d] by the exalt name-titl 'elohim'...\" (articl of faith, p. 466) \"...christ in hi preexistent, antemortal, or unembodi state...wa known as jehovah...\" (articl of faith, p. 471) today mormon leader teach that \"elohim\" in the ot refer to god the father and \"jehovah\" refer to christ. mcconki attack christian for say \"jehovah\" can refer to the father. he stress that these two \"name-titles\" should not be chang around so that christ is call \"elohim\" and the father is call \"jehovah.\" \"...the father...i elohim, not jehovah.... jehovah is christ, and christ is jehovah; they are one and the same person.\" (promis messiah, p. 111) in the ot of the kjv of the bible, the hebrew word \"elohim\" is use to refer to the true god, fals god and goddesses, and the judg of israel. when refer to the true god, \"elohim\" is translat with a capit \"g.\" when refer to fals god and goddess and the judg of israel, it is translat with a small \"g.\" it is translat four time as \"judges\" (exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), onc as \"judge\" (1 sam. 2:25), twice as \"mighty\" (gen. 23:6; exod. 9:28), onc as \"angels\" (ps. 8:5), onc as \"godly\" (mal. 2:15), onc as \"great\" (gen. 30:8), and onc as \"veri great.\" (1 sam. 14:15) the word \"jehovah\" is the tradit pronunci of the tetragramm yhwh or yhvh with the vowel point taken from the word \"adonai.\" mani peopl believ the true pronunci of the tetragramm wa yahweh or yahveh. however, sinc \"jehovah\" rather than yahweh is the word use by mormonism, thi section will also use \"jehovah\" instead of yahweh to examin the valid of the claim of mormon leader regard that name. \"jehovah,\" unlik \"elohim,\" is never use of fals gods. it is the person name of the triun god of the bible. in the kjv, \"jehovah\" is render primarili \"lord,\" sometim \"god,\" and rare \"lord.\" now that we understand someth about the word \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" and their use by mormon leaders, we shall consid the apostl mcconkie' attack on christian for believ the father is \"jehovah.\" in tri to prove that \"jehovah\" refer exclus to christ, mcconki cite sever vers from the bible. some of these vers and mcconkie' interpret of them will be examin to see whether he wa right. remember, mcconki said the father is not \"jehovah;\" he is onli \"elohim.\" the first exampl we shall consid involv mcconkie' interpret of ps. 110:1. of thi vers he stated: \"of whom spake david when hi tongu wa touch by the holi spirit and he testified, \"the lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemi thi footstool?\" (ps. 110:1.) two lord are here involved: one is speak to the other; one is greater than the other; one is make provis for the triumph and glori of the other. who are they and what messag is contain in thi messian prophecy? \"what think ye of christ?\" our lord ask certain of hi detractor toward the end of hi mortal ministry. \"whose son is he?\" is christ the son of god or of someon else? is he to be born of a divin parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? that he wa to be a descend of david wa a matter of great pride to all the jews. and so they answered, \"the son of david.\" david' son? truli he was. but he wa more, much more. and so our lord, with irrefut logic and to their complet discomfiture, asked, \"how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemi thi footstool? if david then call him lord, how is he hi son?\" that is, if he is onli the son of david, how is it that the great king, act under inspiration, call him lord and worship him as such? and we might add: _who is the other lord, the one who spake unto david' lord?_ can there be ani question as to how jesu is interpret the word of the psalm? he is say that it means: '_the father said unto the son, elohim said unto jehovah_, sit thou on my right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then i will rais you up to etern glori and exalt with me, where you will continu to sit on my right hand forever.' (promis messiah, pp. 101-102) (emphasi added) agre with the abov statement by mcconkie, the follow remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormon think of christ, p. 6 reads: \"the lord [elohim, the father] said unto my lord [jehovah, the son]...\" (bracket in original) mcconki clearli state that it is \"elohim\" the father who is speak to \"jehovah\" the son in thi psalm. however, when one look at the hebrew word translat \"lord,\" it becom appar that either the first \"lord\" is not the father or els the father is \"jehovah.\" either way mcconki is wrong. the psalm reads: \"the lord [jehovah] said unto my lord [adon], sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemi thi footstool. (ps. 110:1) the first \"lord\" in thi vers is \"jehovah\" who mormon say is christ, not the father. the second \"lord\" is the hebrew word \"adon\" (singular for \"adonai,\" mean master or lord). if the first \"lord\" is the father and the second \"lord\" is the son, then the father is \"jehovah\" and the son is \"adon.\" however, if the father is not \"jehovah\" as mcconki claimed, then the first \"lord\" is \"jehovah\" the son, but who, then, is \"adon?\" obvious the father is \"jehovah\" in thi psalm, and hi son is \"adon.\" anoth exampl involv isa. 42:6 about which mcconki state the following: \"i the lord have call thee in righteousness,\" _isaiah quot the father as say of christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a coven of the people, for a light of the gentiles.\" (isa. 42:6.) (promis messiah, p. 81) (emphasi added) mcconki said the father wa speak of christ in thi passag which reads: \"i the lord [jehovah] have call thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a coven of the people, for a light of the gentiles. (isa. 42:6) accord to mcconkie, \"i the lord\" refer to the father, and \"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to christ. however, the \"lord\" who is speak is \"jehovah\" which mean either mcconki wa wrong about who is speak or els the father is \"jehovah.\" anoth exampl involv ps. 22:7-8. of these vers mcconki stated: \"the same psalm says: \"all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trust on the lord that he would deliv him: let him deliv him, see he delight in him.\" (ps. 22:7-8.) _the fulfillment, as jesu hung on the cross_, is found in these words: \"the chief priest mock him, with the scribe and elders, said, he save others; himself he cannot save. if he be the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believ him. he trust in god; let him deliv him now, if he will have him: for he said, i am the son of god. the thiev also, which were crucifi with him, cast the same in hi teeth.\" (matt. 27:41-44.) (promis messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasi added) ps. 22:7-8 read as follows: \"all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trust on the lord [jehovah] that he would deliv him: let him deliv him, see he delight in him. mcconki said these vers had their fulfil \"a jesu hung on the cross.\" that mean the person who wa scorn in these vers wa christ. who, then, wa the \"lord\" in whom he trusted? it wa \"jehovah\" the father. anoth exampl involv ps. 31:13 and ps. 41:9. regard them, mcconki state the following: \"with refer to the conniv and conspir plot incid to our lord' arrest and judici trial the propheci was: \"they took counsel togeth against me, they devis to take away my life.\" (ps. 31:13.) as to the role of juda in those conspiracies, the psalmist says: \"mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up hi heel against me.\" (ps. 41:9.) (promis messiah, p. 532) apostl mcconki said these psalm refer to christ' \"arrest and judici trials.\" we shall first consid ps. 31 and then ps. 41. while mcconki onli quot vers 13 of ps. 31, vers 14 will also be includ to give a complet understand of the matter. \"for i have heard the slander of many: fear wa on everi side: while they took counsel togeth against me, they devis to take away my life. but i trust in thee, o lord [jehovah]: i said, thou art my god [elohim]. (ps. 31:13-14) mcconki said vers 13 refer to jesu christ. vers 14 goe on to tell that he (christ) trust in the \"lord\" who is call hi \"god\" or \"elohim.\" mormon teach that the god abov jesu is \"elohim\" the father. vers 14, however, reveal that the \"elohim\" of the man jesu is \"jehovah\" the father. in ps. 41, mcconki onli quot one verse; however, two vers will be consid in thi examination. \"yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up hi heel against me. but thou, o lord [jehovah], be merci unto me, and rais me up, that i may requit them. (ps. 41:9-10) mcconki state abov that vers 9 refer to judas' role in christ' death. sinc it wa juda who wa the \"familiar friend\" who \"lift up hi heel,\" the pronoun \"mine,\" \"i,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in vers 9 must refer to christ. notic that at the begin of vers 10 there is a chang of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refer to the \"lord\" (jehovah). then the pronoun \"me\" and \"i\" which refer to christ are use again. that mean christ wa speak to \"jehovah\" the father in these verses. anoth exampl involv mcconkie' follow remark about ps. 110:4. \"one of the great messian prophecies, spoken by the mouth of david, says: \"the lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek.\" (ps. 110:4.) (promis messiah, p. 450) mcconki admit thi is a messian propheci involv christ. the question is, what in thi vers refer to christ? \"the lord [jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. (ps. 110:4) doe the \"lord,\" which is \"jehovah,\" refer to christ? if mcconki is right and jesu is \"jehovah,\" but the father is not, then the \"lord\" would have to refer to christ. but who, then, is the one address as the \"priest forev after the order of melchizedek?\" the bibl reveal that the one refer to is jesu christ (heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the \"lord\" (jehovah) in ps. 110:4 is the father. anoth exampl involv isa. 53:4-12. of these vers mcconki stated: \"of the aton sacrific of the futur messiah, isaiah said... the _lord_ ha laid on him the iniqu of us all.... it pleas the _lord_ to bruis him... (promis messiah, p. 234) (emphasi added) mcconki rightli said these vers refer to \"the aton sacrific of the futur messiah.\" however, what he fail to mention is that they also prove that the father is \"jehovah.\" vers 6 reads: \"all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turn everi one to hi own way; and the lord [jehovah] hath laid on him [christ] the iniqu of us all,\" and vers 10 reads: \"yet it pleas the lord [jehovah] to bruis him [christ]...\" obvious the \"lord\" who laid on christ \"the iniqu of us all\" and who bruis him is god the father who is call \"jehovah\" in these verses. remember, mcconki state that \"some sectarian even believ that jehovah is the suprem deity,\" and that christ \"came into mortality\" as hi \"onli begotten\" son. he call thi concept \"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" to prove that it is mcconki who is misinform and believ untruth, two scriptur refer (2 sam. 7:14; ps. 2:7) will be examined. mcconki state the follow regard these scriptures: \"in the midst of a passag that is clearli messianic, the lord say of the seed of david: \"i will be hi father, and he shall be my son.\" (2 sam. 7:14.) in the second psalm, the whole of which is also clearli messianic, occur thi statement: \"thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee.\" (ps. 2:7.) paul quot both of these statement in hebrew 1:5 and say they are propheci that christ would come as the son of god. (promis messiah, p. 143) mcconki cite heb. 1:5 to show that 2 sam. 7:14 and ps. 2:7 refer to christ who \"would come as the son of god.\" sinc mcconki first referenc 2 sam. 7:14, thi examin will, too. however, along with vers 14, vers 11-13 will also be included. \"and as sinc the time that i command judg to be over my peopl israel, and have caus thee to rest from all thine enemies. also the lord [jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house. and when thi day be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thi fathers, i will set up thi seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thi bowels, and i will establish hi kingdom. he shall build an hous for my name, and i will stablish the throne of hi kingdom for ever. i will be hi father, and he shall be my son. (2 sam. 7:11-14) these vers teach that the \"lord\" (jehovah) would have a son, the messiah. in the second exampl mcconki cite ps. 2:7. thi examin will includ vers 8. notic that it is the \"lord\" (jehovah) who says, \"thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee.\" \"i will declar the decree: the lord [jehovah] hath said unto me, thou art my son; thi day have i begotten thee. ask of me, and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost part of the earth for thi possession. mcconki said these vers of scriptur are \"clearli messianic,\" and he acknowledg they teach that \"christ would come as the son of god.\" what he is not will to acknowledge, however, is that these scriptur also teach that the father is \"jehovah\" and that the \"sectarians\" who believ \"jehovah is the suprem deiti whose son\" is jesu christ, \"the onli begotten,\" are right in their belief. anoth exampl involv mic. 5:4. of thi vers mcconki state the following: \"and so, truly, did our lord act _dure hi mortal ministry! truly, thi is he of whom it is written_: \"he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord, in the majesti of the name of the lord hi god... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth.\" (mic. 5:4.) (promis messiah, p. 182) (emphasi added) accord to mcconkie, the pronoun \"he\" at the begin of mic. 5:4 refer to christ \"dure hi mortal ministry.\" who, then, is the \"lord hi god?\" mic. 5:4 reads: \"and he [christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord [jehovah], in the majesti of the name of the lord [jehovah] hi god [elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth. obvious the \"lord\" of jesu christ is \"jehovah\" the father who is refer to as \"jehovah hi elohim.\" anoth exampl involv ps. 2:2 and isa. 61:1. of these vers mcconki state the following: \"a number of messian passag speak of \"the lord, and...hi anointed\" (ps. 2:2), signifi that the chosen one wa consecr and set apart for the ministri and mission that wa his. _jesu appli these passag to himself_ by quot isaiah' prophecy. \"the lord hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek\" (isa. 61:1), and then saying: \"thi day is thi scriptur fulfil in your ears\" (luke 4:21). (promis messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasi added) the first sourc mcconki quot -- ps. 2:2 -- read as follows: \"the king of the earth set themselves, and the ruler take counsel together, against the lord [jehovah], and against hi anointed. mcconki said the \"anointed\" one wa christ. if that is true, who wa \"jehovah?\" if \"jehovah\" is alway christ, who wa the \"anointed\" one? obvious \"jehovah\" is refer to god the father and the \"anointed\" is inde refer to christ. the second sourc mcconki cite is isa. 61:1 which states: \"the spirit of the lord [adonai] god [jehovah] is upon me; becaus the lord [jehovah] hath anoint me to preach good tide unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberti to the captives, and the open of the prison to them that are bound; the one who wa anoint to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open wa jesu christ. who, then, wa the one who anoint him? thi vers say the \"lord\" (jehovah) did the anointing. again, we face the same problem. if \"jehovah\" doe not refer to the father, but onli to christ, then jesu anoint someone, but who? as mcconki point out, \"jesu appli these passag to himself.\" therefore, the \"jehovah\" who anoint christ is god the father. other exampl could be cite to show that mcconki and other mormon leader are wrong when they say god the father is not \"jehovah.\" however, these should be enough to expos their error. now, what about mormonism' claim that jesu is \"jehovah,\" but he is not \"elohim?\" it is true that jesu is \"jehovah.\" the follow scriptur prove thi fact: \"thu saith the lord [jehovah] the king of israel, and hi redeem the lord [jehovah] of hosts; i am the first, and i am the last; and besid me there is no god. (isa. 44:6) [jesu said] ...i am the first and the last: i am he that liveth, and wa dead...

(josh. 24:15-16) these vers teach that the onli true, live \"elohim\" in heaven and on earth is \"jehovah\" -- the triun god who made heaven and earth and all therein. \"jehovah\" is greater than ani \"elohim,\" becaus all other \"elohim\" are idols. the realiti behind them is demonic. (deut. 32:17) \"jehovah elohim\" ha given explicit warn and guidelin regard these fals \"elohim.\" he told hi peopl not to have ani \"elohim\" but him. he told the peopl that if they left him for the fals \"elohim,\" those \"elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. he warn the peopl to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be not deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swear by, and make coven with fals \"elohim.\" \"jehovah elohim\" told hi peopl he would eventu judg all fals \"elohim\" and their followers. despit these warn and guidelines, \"elohim's\" coven peopl forsook him and believ in and worship the fals \"elohim's\" of the peopl they came in contact with. ju. 10:6 state that \"the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord [jehovah] and serv baalim, and ashtaroth, and the god [elohim] of syria, and the god [elohim] of zidon, and the god [elohim] of moab, and the god [elohim] of the children of ammon, and the god [elohim] of the philistines, and forsook the lord [jehovah], and serv not him.\" thi examin ha shown that the \"elohim\" of mormonism, like the \"elohim\" in ju. 10:6 is not the true \"jehovah elohim.\" therefore, the peopl who leav the true \"elohim\" for the mormon \"elohim\" will do \"evil...in the sight of the lord [jehovah].\" although mcconki attack christian for their belief in a triun god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father [jehovah] sent hi son into the world, these belief are true. god is triune; he is spirit; he is \"jehovah;\" and he did send hi son into the world to redeem mankind. it is obviou from thi examin that it is not the christian who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"elohim\" and \"jehovah\" are. one wonder what \"holi writ\" mcconki had in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that \"elohim is the father, and that jehovah is the son.\" he certainli did not mean the bibl which teach that the father, son, and holi spirit are all the one \"jehovah elohim.\" he appar did not mean the d&c either, becaus chapter 109, vers 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the father as \"jehovah.\" summari obvious joseph field smith' statement that the mormon \"have a clear and perfect understand of the natur of god\" (doctrin of salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. the mormon god are not the true god as mormon claims, but are idol which caus their follow to commit adulteri against god and idolatry. in answer to jesus' question, \"but whom say ye that i am,\" mormon say jesu is someon differ from the jesu who is reveal in the bibl and whom the apostl preached. therefore, anyon trust in the mormon jesu is believ in \"anoth jesus\" whom paul warn about. bernard p. brockbank, of the first quorum of the seventy, admit in the may 1977 issu of the ensign, a mormon publication, that the mormon jesu is differ from the christian jesus. he state that \"it is true that mani of the christian church worship a differ jesu christ than is worship by the mormon or the church of jesu christ of latter-day saints.\" (p. 26) the peopl who believ in the mormon jesu are commit adulteri against god and idolatry. they do not have the son; therefore, they do not have the father, and they do not have etern life. as the apostl bruce r. mcconki rightli stated: \"salvat come onli by worship the true god.\" (promis messiah, p. 163) mcconki also rightli state that \"the mere worship of a god who ha the proper scriptur name doe not assur one that he is worship the true and live god,\" becaus the \"true name of deity\" can be appli to \"fals concept of god.\" (mormon doctrine, p. 270) rememb that the apostl stephen l. richard admit that joseph smith, jr., gave \"a new concept of god and the godhead.\" (contribut of joseph smith, p. 1) it is import for the peopl who have left the true triun god reveal in the bibl to repent and return to him. they must forsak the sin of idolatri and adulteri which they are commit in mormonism. the bibl says: \"...all that forsak thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, becaus they have forsaken the lord [jehovah], the fountain of live waters.

well, the best thing to do is to read the book \"parallel universes\" by dr. fred wolf. in essence, dr. wolf say that one interpret of the sub-atom particle/wav dualiti is that what we perceiv as a wave is actual an infin number of parallel univers overlaid, and in each of these univers there is a particl in a differ location. when we do someth to make a particl \"appear,\" we are actual caus all the parallel univers to collaps into one. appar thi is one line of thought on the natur of qm, that is go through some of the scientif community. dr. wolf (and mani others) claim that somehow the collaps is caus by the mental effort of observ the particle. thi impli that mind is more than mere a biolog phenomenon. he then extrapol that if mind is an integr part of the universe, then perhap conscious is the element that give order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s). it all get rather interesting, but what i find facin is that thi would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practic in my religion. dr. wolf specul that the order function of mind could be caus by the select of a futur from an infinit number of possibl futures; he say that thi might be done by some sort of commun between one current, and possibl futur selves. i have long specul that if magick is not mere a form of self delus then perhap it could be caus by some sort of a select of one of mani possibl futures. i realiz that thi get pretti bizarre, but it never hurt to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as anoth possibil explain of the world in which we find ourselves. after all, the more we learn about the univers in which we live, the more we learn that it is truli a veri strang place. >nanci eric newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84312 from: emarsh@hernes-sun.eng.sun.com (eric marsh) subject: re: after 2000 years, can we say that christian moral is in articl <1r66su$dm7@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@d012s658.uucp (frank o'dwyer) writes: >in articl <sandvik-210493213823@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (kent sandvik) writes: >#frank, unless you didn't realiz it, you are just now involv >#in a debat where we have variou opinions, and each entiti >#ha it own frame where the opinion is expressed. i think i >#don't need to state the dread r-word. >so, it' _sometimes_ correct to say that moral is objective, or what?

[however, the major of the book is in hellenist arama (not babylonian aramaic) and onli ha kethuvim or write status.] ref: encyclopedia of religion, mircea eliade: daniel, or, in hebrew, daniyye'l; hero of the biblic book that bear hi name. daniel is present as a jew in the babylonian exil who achiev notorieti in the royal court for hi dream interpret and cryptographi and for hi salvat from death in a lion' pit. he also appear in the last chapter of the book as the reveal of divin mysteri and of the timet of israel' restor to national-religi autonomy. as a practition of oneirom in the court, describ in daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), daniel per- form hi interpret alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decod hi vision and mysteri of the future. it is like that the name daniel is pseudonymous, a deliber allus to a wise and righteou man known from ugarit legend and earlier biblic tradition. (ez. 14:4,28:3). the authorship of the book is complic not onli by the divers narr voic and content but by it language: daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in hebrew, wherea daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in aramaic. the languag divis parallel the subject divis (daniel 1-6 concern legend and dream interpretations; 7-12 concern apocalypt vision and interpret of older prophecies). the overal chronolog scheme as well as intern themat balanc (daniel 2-7 is chiliast related) suggest an attempt at redact unity. after the prefatori tale emphas the life in court and the loyalti of daniel and some youth to their ancestr religion, a chronolog order is discernable: a sequenc from king nebuchadrezzar to dariu is report (dn. 7-12). much of thi royal date and even some of the tale are problematic: for example, daniel 4 speak of nebuchadrezzar' transform into a beast, a stori that is report in the qumran scroll of nabonidus; belshazzar is portray as the last king of babylon, although he wa never king; and dariu is call a mede who conquer babylon and is place befor cyru ii of persia, although no such dariu is known (the mede follow the persians, and dariu is the name of sever persian kings). presum the episod of daniel 2-6, depict a seri of monarch reversals, episod of ritual observances, and report of miracul deliver were collect in the seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second centuri bce) in order to reinvigor wane jewish hope in divin provid and encourag steadfast faith. the vision of daniel 7-12, report event from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyru ii (but actual predict the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine), were collect and publish dure the reign of antiochu iv prior to the maccabean revolt, for it wa then (begin in 168 bce) that the jew were put to the test concern their allegi to judaism and their ancestr traditions, and mani refus to desecr the statu of mose and endur a martyr' death for their resolut trust in divin dominion. all of the vision of daniel dramat thi dominion in differ ways: for example, via imag of the enthron of a god of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invest with rule (thi figur wa interpret by jew as michael the archangel and by christian as christ), in chapter 7; via zodiac imag of cosmic beast with bizarr manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpret of ancient prophecies, especi those of jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in daniel 9-12. the imageri of the four beast in chapter 7 (parallel by the imag of four metal in chapter 2), repres four kingdom to be overthrown by a fifth monarchi of divin origin, is one of the endur imag of the book; it sur- vive as a prototyp of jewish and christian histor and apocalypt scheme to the end of the middl ages. the role and power of thi imageri in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuri work of the exeget isaac abravanel, the scientist isaac newton, and the philosoph jean bodin and among the fifth monarchi men of seventeenth centuri england, for example, is abid testimoni to the use of thi ancient topo in organ the chiliast imagin of divers thinker and groups. the schema is still use to thi day by variou group predict the apocalypt advent. the encourag in the face of religi persecut that is found and propagand in daniel 11-12 contain a remark reinterpret of isaiah 52:13-53:12, regard the suffer servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful. neither the open stori about daniel and the youth nor the final martyrolog allus advoc violenc or revolt; they rather advoc a stanc of piety, civil disobedience, and trust resignation. victori for the faith is in the hand of the archangel michael, and the martyr will be resurrect and grant astral immortality. persum the circl behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighter and may reflect some proto-pharisa group of hasidim, or pietists. the theme of resist to oppression, freedom of worship, preserv of monotheist integrity, the overthrow of histor dominions, and the acknowledg of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have serv as a token of trust for the faith in their darkest hour. zarathushtra, founder of the religion know as zoroastrian or mazdaism (from mazda or ahura mazda, the name of the god prophesi by zarathushtra.) the etymolog and histori of zarathushtra, the avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in variou iranian languag and in relat form else- where. there may have been an old persian form, zara-ushtra, from which the greek form, zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have exist an old iranian form, zarat-ushtra, to which may be link the middl iranian zrdrwsht, sever middl persian form (such as zrtwsht), and the new persian zardusht. we can state with certainti onli that the second half of the name, ushtra, mean \"camel.\" the form zoroaster, deriv from the greek zoroastres, wa use tradit in european cultur until the eighteenth century, when zarathustra, closer to the origin (and as found in nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscoveri of the avesta, the collect of sacr book of zoroastrianism, and the result studi in iranian philology. [see avesta.] notwithstand the great and continu popular of zarathushtra, even in western culture, the sourc avail to us are few, extrem fragmented, and heterogeneous. our principl sourc are the five gatha (\"songs\"), attribut to zarathushtra himself and includ in the yasna section of the avesta: gatha ahunava (yasna 28-34), gatha ushtava (yasna 43-46), gatha spentamainyu (yasna 47-50), gatha vokukhshathra (yasna 51), and gatha vashishtoishti (yasna 53), the last of which wa probabl written after the prophet' death. other sourc of considerable, albeit varying, import are the younger avesta and the remain zoroastrian religi literature, in particular the pahlavi text of the ninth and tenth centur ce. although the achaemenid inscript (sixth to fourth centur bce) never mention zarathushtra, he is mention by some greek sourc of the time (not, however, by herodotus, who seem unawar of him). the avesta doe not provid ani direct or explicit data concern the true chronolog histori of zarathushtra. but the text is use in an indirect way, as it clearli impli that the environ in which zoroastrian aros wa not that of iran under the mede or the persians. the greek sources, on the other hand, do provid some inform concern the time of zarathushtra, although from a histor point of view they are unreliable. some place him six thousand year befor the trojan war (xanthu of lydia, eudoxu of cnidus, hermippus, hermodorus, aristotle, plutarch, diogen laertius, and pliny). the account by xanthu of lydia, however, ha also been interpret by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, year befor the expedit of xerx against greece. thi interpret is favor by diogen laertius, who make refer to xanthus, but although a few scholar (a. s. shabazi, helmut humbach) have recent attempt to rehabilit it under variou pretexts, it is gener rejected. although the histor valu of the greek sourc is negligible, they are nonetheless import in that they show that the millenarian doctrin of histori of the cosmo had alreadi been develop in iran by the achaemenid period, as the abov account would seem to demonstrate. they also show that by thi time zarathushtra wa alreadi seen as an almost mythic figure, one from an extrem distant past. all of thi lead to the conclus that the prophet could not have belong to a histor period contemporari with, or even close to, that of the achaemenids. later zoroastrian sources, the pahlavi texts, do provid an absolut chrono- logi for zarathushtra, one that wa also accept by some arab authors. accord- ing to these sources, zarathushtra live 300 or 258 year befor alexander. again, scholar are divid on the valid of the chronology; some view it as histor reliabl while other believ that it is devoid of histor justification. the most convinc arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. the figur of 258 year is accur onli on the surfac becaus it represents, in fact, the more gener one of 300, which wa employ by sasanid propagandist to locat zarathushtra' lifetim roughli around the begin of iranian domination. for a number of reason connect with complex problem inher in the iranian chronology, there wa also a desir on the part of the sasanid propagandist to avoid ani millenarian threat. in thi context, zarathushtra, whom tradit place earli in the ninth millennium after the begin of the cosmos, convert vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and vishtaspa' convers wa view by some as the begin of the millennium (thu explain the doubl date of 300 and 258 year befor alexander). given the unreli of the few avail sources, we are forc to reconstruct an absolut chronolog on the basi of other elements, princip on the content that zarathushtra must have live a few centuri befor cyru the great, cambyses, and darius, as there is no mention in the avesta of the great polit achiev that took place in western iran in the middl of the first millennium bce. nor is there ani mention of the histori of that period, which wa to lead iran to a posit of such predominance. at the same time, for a number of reasons, go back much further in histori would not be justified. consequently, the tradit accept theori of place zara- thushtra around the begin of the first millennium bce appear to be the most legitimate. as to zarathushtra' land of origin, mani scholar agree, on the basi of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern iran. some have held that he wa a mede, larg becaus of a late iranian tradit link zarathushtra with azerbaijan, but also becaus of linguist reasons, base on the languag of the avesta. thi hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on histor and linguist grounds, that zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precis from which region. there is a consider varieti of opinion on thi particular matter, includ the improb view that he came from chorasmia, or present-day khorezm, or from a wider chorasmian region, reach as far as the oas of merv and herat. most likely, however, zarathushtra' land of origin is somewher in the vast area stretch from the hindu kush mountain rang to the more southern region of bactria and arachosia (modern qandahar), as well as drangiana (the area of lake helmand). it would thu be locat in what is now afghanistan or in the border region of iran. zarathushtra himself tell us that he belong to the priestli cast (yasna 33.6). he wa a zaotar (cf. sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belong to a specif group connect with a school that produc veri elabor and learn religi poetry. even in the so-cal younger avesta he is describ as an athravan (yasht 13.94), a more gener term encompass the entir priestli caste. to enter it he had undergon a long and rigid training, which he use to lend digniti (a in the gathas) to the content of hi new message, the product of a great and origin ethic mind. zarathushtra also belong to that vener priestli tradition, link india to iran in anoth way, by center hi teach on the prais of the ashavan, or \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the vedic rtavan, seek truth and master it, thu becom ashavan in thi life - almost an initi - and bless after death. ani good follow of such teach seek the \"vision of asha,\" just as those chose the right path in vedic india aspir to the \"vision of the sun,\" a manifest of rta. behind these concept and thi languag lie the great tradit of \"aryan mysticism,\" that is, of indo-iranian mysticism. zarathushtra' greatness, however, doe not lie in hi have belong to a particular religi tradition. rather, it lie in the innov and strength of hi message, which wa in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fulli and effect introduc two great revolutionari ideas: dualist monoth (the wise lord who father two twin spirits, the benefic and the evil); and the expect of a transfigur (av., frashokereti; pahl., frashgird) of life and existence. [see frashokereti] both hi monotheist and dualist idea and hi particular soteriolog doctrin deepli separ zarathushtra' teach from the indo-iranian tradi- tion of hi upbringing. they exemplifi hi rebellion against a formalist and ritualist religion that did not provid adequ answer to the problem of evil. becaus of hi basic tenets, zarathushtra, who advoc an inward religios and the right of the individu to resist the imper of tradi- tion, can be number among the greatest of religi figures. anoth origin facet of zarathushtra' message, one that is not easi to understand but which, however, hold the key to a deeper understand of the complex intellectu and poetic structur of the gathas, is the doctrin of the amesha spentas, the \"benefic immortals.\" these are spiritu of the abstract notion of good thought, best truth, desir power, bounteou devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which oper accord to a system of interrel and correl and can simultan be the manifest of a divin and of human virtue. [see amesha spentas.] other than the name of hi father, pourushaspa (\"possess gray horses\"), and of hi mother, dughdova (\"one who ha milked\"), we know almost noth of zarathushtra' life. a late pahlavi text also give the name of four brothers. accord to tradition, zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirti he wa subject to a revelation, both through an intens and power inspir and through a vision. onli after ten year had passed, however, did he succeed in convert a cousin of his, maidhyoimah, to hi beliefs. he wa strongli oppos in hi nativ land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestli group associ with tradit teach and practices. thi hostil caus him to leav hi region (yasna 46:1) and to seek refug at the court of kavi vishtaspa, a ruler who had been convert to the new religion togeth with hi wife, hutaosa, when the prophet, accord to tradition, wa forty-two year old. we also know the name of a son, isat vastra (\"desir pastures\"), and of three daughter born of hi first wife, as well as the name of two more sons, urvatatnara (\"command men\") and hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of hi second wife, hvovi, a member of the influenti hvogva (\"possess good cattle\") family. two other figur belong to the hvogva famili are mentioned: frashaoshtra and jamaspa, the former as hvovi' father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, pouruchista (\"veri thoughtful\"), whose wed is celebr in the fifth hymm in the gatha (yasna 53). again, accord to tradition, zarathushtra die at the age of seventy-seven. he wa assassin by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belong to the tuirya tribe and wa call tur i bradr (hi name is known onli in the pahlavi form). the pauciti of inform on the prophet' life is compens by a tradi- tion, rich in legendari detail, that aros through the centuri in zoroastrian communities. the main text document the tradit are the seventh book of the denkard, a pahlavi work date from the ninth centuri ce, as well as passag from other pahlavi text and a new persian work from the thirteenth century, the zarathusht-nama (book of zarathushtra), written by zaratusht-i bahram-i pazhdu. mythic and ritual element prevail in the later legend about zarathushtra, which ideal him into a symbol and make him the archetyp of the perfect man. zarathushtra' great popular in the ancient world continu throughout the renaiss until the enlightenment. dure the classic and hellenist period he wa view as a wise man, a typic repres of an \"alien wisdom,\" a master of the secret of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. pythagorean thinker went so far as to see the influenc of zarathushtra on pythagora himself, and the academician alway openli admir the persian thinker who found the school of the magi and advoc a doctrin of dualism. earliest christian view zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith, one who not onli prophesied, as had the biblic prophets, the advent of the messiah but also predict the supernatur sign of hi coming, the star that wa to appear in the east and guid the three magi to the manger in bethlehem. [see magi.] thi christian interpret is deriv from the zoroastrian doctrin of the saoshyant, the savior of the future. [see saoshyant.] later, however, religi struggl aros dure the sasanid empir in persia (third to seventh centuri ce), which link the spread of christian with the roman empire. zarathushtra' popular in the christian world began to decline. the iranian prophet, who had been prais often by the gnostic school and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messeng from the past, wa now seen, instead, as a leader of impostur and heresy, a teacher of the diabol art of witchery. but dure the renaiss- anc and the enlightenment, european cultur revert to the imag of zara- thushtra that had come down through classic and hellenist antiquity. he wa viewed, onc again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _chaldean oracles_ and probabl inventor of qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possibl bridg between christian and platonism, and, at time (a in voltaire), as a symbol of non-christian wisdom. after western philolog rediscov zarathushtra dure the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, friedrich nietzsche, in an intent paradox, gave the name zarathustra to the hero of hi work _also sprach zarathustra_ (1883- 1892). nietzsch saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discov the true motiv forc underli all things, that is, the etern struggl between good and evil.

provid you with food, then you can be stupid and unemploy and it' ok. thi is whi marri women usual didn't work until recent decades. 2. author figures, such as god, whoever wa behind the vietnam war,

on a silver platter. onc they had gain knowledg and (bi seek it) show their abil to make matur decis for them- selves, they no longer need to be treat like littl children and were reward by be allow into the \"real world.\" lesson from new interpretation: 1. ignor is bad. knowledg is good, but must be sought. 2. have food provid for you for noth (read \"welfare\") is at best a temporari measure. get a job and feed yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3. public nuditi is bad. cover up is good. 4. author figur are often wrong. normal peopl are intellig and should consid whether the instruct are realli a good idea and \"alter or abolish\" bad governments. they should think for themselves. 5. peopl in subordin decis are often discourag from knowledg but should seek it anyway, and all the harder. for example, poor children without good school should work especi hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves). i have tent name thi new philosophi \"the church of eveism\" becaus eve' decis to eat the appl is man[sic]kind' first good decision, instead of it first bad one, as tradit believed. she is therefor clearli a protagonist. god at first appear evil, for tell peopl not to seek knowledg but on deeper analysi is also a protagonist. as god reward the decis to defi him, and provid the tree in the first place, the intent and desir were clearli to have the knowledg be obtained, but to delay it until it wa activ sought. ---end seriou discussion. begin humor.-- save thi post to disk (or file server). someday it will be consid the most import write sinc

of cours not. and what about bisexuals? are they half-nazis? i don't know whi it would be so difficult to believ that some nazi were homosexuals. the german offic corp befor ww1, for instance, wa notori for it homosexuality. there were numer scandal which rock the german govt. dure the late 19th and earli 20th century. mani of the kaiser' friend were prosecut - the kaiser wa no homosexual, but the germani armi had a long tradit of toler homosexuality, go far back into prussian histori - back to frederick the great at least, who wa himself a homosexual. roehm wa a product of thi prussian offic tradition, and the old german armi (like the english public school system), be a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quit will to overlook roehm' homosexuality. in addition, some nazi complain of homosexu in the hitler youth. the hitler youth swallow up all pre-nazi youth groups, and some of the variou pre-war vandervogel, bund, and volkish youth group were known to promot homoerot ideal and friendship, and in mani cases, homosexu itself. so it seem to me not unlik that there were plenti of homosexu nazis, regardless of the offici nazi dogma concern the \"evils\" of homosexuality. whi should thi supris anyone?

(note: thi paragraph record not onli rams \"divin word,\" but also that there were thousand of wit to the event. now from the heart of battle.) then hi majesti drove at a gallop and charg the forc of the foe from hitti, be alon by himself, none other with him. hi majesti proceed to look about him and found 2500 chariot ring him on hi way out ... no offic wa with me, no charioteer, no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; my infantry, my chariotri yield befor them, not one of them stood firm to fight with them. hi majesti spoke: \"what is this, father amun? is it right for a father to ignor hi son? are my deed a matter for you to ignore? do i not walk and stand at your word? i have not neglect an order you gave. too great is he, the great lord of egypt, to allow alien to step on hi path! what are these asiat to you, o amun, the wretch ignor of god? have i not made for you mani great monuments, ... i call to you, my father amun, i am among a host of strangers; all countri are array against me, i am alone, there' none with me! ... the labor of mani peopl are nothing, amun is more help than they; i came here by the command of your mouth, o amun, i have not transgress your command!\" now though i pray in a distant land, my voic resound in southern thebes. i found amun came when i call to him, he gave me hi hand and i rejoiced. he call from behind as if near by: \"forward, i am with you, i your father, my hand is with you, i prevail over a hundr thousand men, i am lord of victory, lover of valor!\" i found my heart stout, my breast in joy, all i did succeeded, i wa like mont. ... i slaughter among them at my will, not one look behind him, not one turn around, whoever fell down did not rise. ... one call out to the other saying: \"no man is he who is among us, it is seth great-of-strength, baal in person; not deed of man are these hi doings, they are of one who is unique, who fight a hundr thousand without soldier and chariots, come quick, flee befor him, to seek life and breath air; for he who attempt to get close to him, hi hands, all hi limb grow limp. one cannot hold either bow or spears, when one see him come race along!\" my majesti hunt them like a griffin, i slaughter among them unceasingly. so you see brian, we have a few origin manuscript record the miracul battl between the rams and the hittites. do you reject them as be *completely* true? i suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words: \"question the exist of alexand the great, tilgrath pilisar iii, nero, caligula, josephus, cyru the great, artexerxes?\" do you also therebi question all their documents? that` the problem with your \"all or nothing\" approach. mani ancient peopl use to mix a bit of fanci with their facts. so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter (and the rest of the new testament) or accept no record of antiqu at all, forc you thereby, to accept the veriti of document you probabl do not find complet

three points. first, thi is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth. for instance, do the million of hindu' past and present who testifi to the realiti of brahma, constitut actual evid for the exist of brahma? how would you answer your own question in regard to the testimoni of hindus: \"with a scoff of your keyboard, with near complet ignor of the testimonies, are you go to say that that is all complet hooey?\" if you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you object justifi your own special pleading? second, it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testifi to jesus. you can claim it to be clear, but that doe not make it true. third, it is quit arguabl that abraham lincoln wa not christian, and that he had both a public and a privat view of christianity. in fact there wa much discuss about it in hi day (yes, he wa public accus of be a deist. oh my). i am present collect a faq for lincoln as i'v previous done for tyre, jefferson

subject: larsonian astronomy, physics, creation the follow partial summari of a theori of the univers includ a little-known descript of the creation of our solar system: larsonian astronomi and physic orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicist claim to be look for a \"unifi field theory\" in which all of the forc of the univers can be explain with a singl set of law or equations. but they have been systemat ignor or suppress an excel one for 30 years! the late physicist dewey b. larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, which he call the \"reciproc system\", is built on two fundament postul about the physic and mathemat natur of space and time: (1) \"the physic univers is compos entir of one component, motion, exist in three dimensions, in discret units, and in two reciproc forms, space and time.\" (2) \"the physic univers conform to the relat of ordinari commut mathematics, it magnitud are absolute, and it geometri is euclidean.\" from these two postulates, larson develop a complet theoret universe, use variou combin of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotat motions, the concept of in-ward and out-ward scalar motions, and speed in relat to the speed of light (which larson call \"unit velocity\" and \"the natur datum\"). at each step in the development, larson wa abl to match object in hi theoret univers with object in the real physic universe, (photons, sub-atom particl [incomplet atoms], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binari star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, etc.), even object not yet discov then (such as explod galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts). and appli hi theori to hi new model of the atom, larson wa abl to precis and accur calcul inter- atom distanc in crystal and molecules, compress and thermal expans of solids, and other properti of matter. all of thi is describ in good detail, with-out fanci complex mathematics, in hi books. book of dewey b. larson the follow is a complet list of the late physicist dewey b. larson' book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe. some of the earli book are out of print now, but still avail through inter-librari loan. \"the structur of the physic universe\" (1959) \"the case against the nuclear atom\" (1963) \"beyond newton\" (1964) \"new light on space and time\" (1965) \"quasar and pulsars\" (1971) \"noth but motion\" (1979) [a $9.50 substitut for the $8.3 billion \"super collider\".] [the last four chapter explain chemic bonding.] \"the neglect fact of science\" (1982) \"the univers of motion\" (1984) [final solut to most all astrophys mysteries.] \"basic properti of matter\" (1988) all but the last of these book were publish by north pacif publishers, p.o. box 13255, portland, or 97213, and should be avail via inter-librari loan if your local univers or public librari doesn't have each of them. sever of them, includ the last one, are avail from: the intern societi of unifi scienc (isus), 1680 e. atkin ave., salt lake city, utah 84106. thi is the organ that wa start to promot larson' theory. they have other relat publications, includ the quarterli journal \"reciprocity\". physicist dewey b. larson' background physicist dewey b. larson wa a retir engin (chemic or electrical). he wa about 91 year old when he die in may 1989. he had a bachelor of scienc degre in engin scienc from oregon state university. he develop hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers while tri to develop a way to comput chemic properti base onli on the element used. larson' lack of a fanci \"ph.d.\" degre might be one reason that orthodox physicist are ignor him, but it is not a valid reason. sometim it take a rel outsid to clearli see the forest through the trees. at the same time, it is clear from hi book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomi as well as ani physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their contradictions, ad hoc assumptions, principl of impotence, in-consistencies, etc.. larson did not have the funds, etc. to experiment test hi theory. and it wa not necessari for him to do so. he simpli compar the variou part of hi theori with other researchers' experiment and observ data. and in mani cases, hi explan fit better. a self-consist theori is much more than the orthodox physicist and astronom have! they claim to be look for a \"unifi field theory\" that works, but have been ignor one for over 30 year now! \"modern physics\" doe not explain the physic univers so well. some part of some of larson' book are full of quotat of lead orthodox physicist and astronom who agree. and rememb that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., also onc seem to explain it well, but were later prove conceptu wrong. prof. frank h. meyer, professor emeritu of uw-superior, was/i a strong propon of larson' theory, and wa (or still is) presid of larson' organization, \"the intern societi of unifi science\", and editor of their quarterli journal \"reciprocity\". he move to minneapoli after retiring. \"super collider\" boondoggle! i am against contruct of the \"superconduct super collider\", in texa or anywher else. it would be a gross wast of money, and contribut almost noth of \"scientific\" value. most physicist don't realiz it, but, accord to the comprehens gener unifi theori of the late physicist dewey b. larson, as describ in hi books, the strang goofi particl (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", alleg \"quarks\", etc.) which they are find in exist collid (fermi lab, cern, etc.) are realli just atom of anti-matter, which are creat by the high-energi collid beams, and which quickli disintegr like cosmic ray becaus they are incompat with their environment. a larger and more expens collid will onli creat a few more element of anti-matt that the physicist have not seen there before, and the physicist will be even more confus than they are now! are a few more type of anti-matt atom worth the $8.3 billion cost?!! don't we have much more import use for thi wast money?! anoth thing to consid is that the primari propos locat in texa ha a seriou and grow problem with some kind of \"fire ants\" eat the insul off underground cables. how much poison of the ground and ground water with insecticid will be requir to keep the ant out of the \"supercollider\"?! name the \"super collider\" after ronald reagon, as proposed, is total absurd! if it is built, it should be name after a lead particl physicist. larsonian anti-matt in larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, anti-matt is not a simpl case of opposit charg of the same type of particles. it ha more to do with the rate of vibrat and rotat of the photon of which they are made, in relat to the vibrat and rotat equival of the speed of light, which larson call \"unit velocity\" and the \"natur datum\". in larson' theory, a positron is actual a particl of matter, not anti-matter. when a positron and electron meet, the rotat vibrat (charges) and rotat of their respect photon (of which they are made) neutral each other. in larson' theory, the anti-matt half of the physic univers ha three dimens of time, and onli one dimens of space, and exist in a reciproc relationship to our materi half. larsonian rel the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercuri ha been observ and precis measur to advanc at the rate of 574 second of arc per century. 531 second of thi advanc are attribut via calcul to gravit perturb from the other planet (venus, earth, jupiter, etc.). the remain 43 second of arc are be use to help \"prove\" einstein' \"gener theori of relativity\". but the late physicist dewey b. larson achiev result closer to the 43 second than \"gener relativity\" can, by instead use \"special relativity\". in one or more of hi books, he appli the lorentz transform on the high orbit speed of mercury. larson total reject \"gener relativity\" as anoth mathemat fantasy. he also reject most of \"special relativity\", includ the part about \"mass increases\" near the speed of light, and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts, (those quasar with red-shift greater than 1.000 realli are move faster than the speed of light, although most of that motion is away from us in time.). in larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, there are three dimens of time instead of onli one. but two of those dimens can not be measur from our materi half of the physic universe. the one dimens that we can measur is the clock time. at low rel speeds, the valu of the other two dimens are negligible; but at high speeds, they becom significant, and the lorentz transform must be use as a fudg factor. [larson often use the term \"coordin time\" when write about this.] in regard to \"mass increases\", it ha been proven in atom acceler that acceler drop toward zero near the speed of light. but the formula for acceler is acceler = forc / mass, (a = f/m). orthodox physicist are ignor the third factor: force. in larson' theory, mass stay constant and forc drop toward zero. forc is actual a motion, or combin of motions, or relat between motions, includ inward and outward scalar motions. the expans of the universe, for example, is an outward scalar motion inher in the univers and not a result of the so-cal \"big bang\" (which is yet anoth mathemat fantasy). the univers of motion i wish to recommend to everyon the book \"the univers of motion\", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacif publishers, (p.o. box 13255, portland, oregon 97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. it contain the astrophys portion of a gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by that author, an unrecogn genius, more than thirti year ago. it contain final solut to most all astrophys mysteries, includ the format of galaxies, binari and multipl star systems, and solar systems, the true origin of the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the true natur of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, explod galaxies, etc.. it contain what astronom and astrophysicist are all look for, if they are readi to serious consid it with open minds! the follow is an exampl of hi theory' success: in hi first book in 1959, \"the structur of the physic universe\", larson predict the exist of explod galaxies, sever year befor astronom start find them. they are a necessari consequ of larson' comprehens theory. and when quasar were discovered, he had an immedi relat explan for them also. gamma-ray burst astro-physicist and astronom are still scratch their head about the mysteri gamma-ray bursts. they were origin thought to origin from \"neutron stars\" in the disc of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescop now in earth orbit ha been detect them in all direct uniformly, and their sourc locat in space do not correspond to ani known objects, (except for a few case of direct coincidence). gamma-ray burst are a necessari consequ of the gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson. accord to page 386 of hi book \"the univers of motion\", publish in 1984, the gamma-ray burst are come from supernova explos in the anti-matt half of the physic universe, which larson call the \"cosmic sector\". becaus of the relationship between the anti-matt and materi halv of the physic universe, and the way they are connect together, the gamma-ray burst can pop into our materi half anywher in space, seemingli at random. (thi is whi the sourc locat of the burst do not correspond with known objects, and come from all direct uniformly.) i wonder how close to us in space a sourc locat would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth! there would be no way to predict one, nor to stop it! perhap some of the mass extinct of the past, which are now be blame on impact of comet and asteroids, were actual caus by nearbi gamma-ray bursts! larsonian binari star format about half of all the star in the galaxi in the vicin of the sun are binari or double. but orthodox astronom and astrophysicist still have no satisfactori theori about how they form or whi there are so mani of them. but binari star system are actual a like consequ of the comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson. i will tri to summar larson explanation, which is detail in chapter 7 of hi book \"the univers of motion\" and in some of hi other books. first of all, accord to larson, star do not gener energi by \"fusion\". a small fraction come from slow gravit collapse. the rest result from the complet annihil of heavi element (heavier than iron). each element ha a destruct temperatur limit. the heavier the element is, the lower is thi limit. a star' intern temperatur increas as it grow in mass via accret and absorpt of the decay product of cosmic rays, gradual reach the destruct temperatur limit of lighter and lighter elements. when the intern temperatur of the star reach the destruct temperatur limit of iron, there is a type i supernova explosion! thi is becaus there is so much iron present; and that is relat to the structur of iron atom and the atom build process, which larson explain in some of hi book [better than i can]. when the star explodes, the lighter materi on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light. the heavier materi in the center portion of the star wa alreadi bounc around at close to the speed of light, becaus of the high temperature. the explos push that materi over the speed of light, and it expand outward in time, which is equival to inward in space, and it often actual disappear for a while. over long period of time, both mass start to fall back gravitationally. the materi that had been blown outward in space now start to form a red giant star. the materi that had been blown outward in time start to form a white dwarf star. both star then start move back toward the \"main sequence\" from opposit direct on the h-r diagram. the chanc of the two mass fall back into the exact same locat in space, make a singl lone star again, are near zero. they will instead form a binari system, orbit each other. accord to larson, a white dwarf star ha an invers densiti gradient (i densest at it surface), becaus the materi at it center is most wide dispers (blown outward) in time. thi elimin the need to resort to mathemat fantasi about \"degener matter\", \"neutron stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. larsonian solar system format if the mass of the heavi materi at the center of the explod star is rel small, then, instead of a singl white dwarf star, there will be sever \"mini\" white dwarf star (revolv around the red giant star, but probabl still too far away in three-dimension time to be affect by it heat, etc.). these will becom planets! in chapter 7 of the univers of motion, larson use all thi information, and other principl of hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, to deriv hi own version of bode' law. \"black hole\" fantasy! i heard that physicist stephen w. hawk recent complet a theoret mathemat analysi of two \"black holes\" merg togeth into a singl \"black hole\", and conclud that the new \"black hole\" would have more mass than the sum of the two origin \"black holes\". such a result should be recogn by everyon as a red flag, caus widespread doubt about the whole idea of \"black holes\", etc.! after read physicist dewey b. larson' book about hi comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe, especi hi book \"the univers of motion\", it is clear to me that \"black holes\" are noth more than mathemat fantasies! the strang object at cygnu x-1 is just an unusu massiv white dwarf star, not the \"black hole\" that orthodox astronom and physicist so badli want to \"prove\" their theory. by the way, i do not understand whi so much public is be given to physicist stephen hawking. the physicist and astronom seem to be act as if hawking' sever physic problem somehow make him \"wiser\". it doe not! i wish the same attent had been given to physicist dewey b. larson while he wa still alive. widespread public and attent should now be given to larson' theory, books, and organ (the intern societi of unifi science). electro-magnet propuls i heard of that concept mani year ago, in connect with ufo' and unorthodox inventors, but i never wa abl to find out how or whi they work, or how they are constructed. i found a possibl clue about whi they might work on page 112-113 of the book \"basic properti of matter\", by the late physicist dewey b. larson, which describ part of larson' comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic universe. i quot one paragraph: \"a indic in the preced chapter, the develop of the theori of the univers of motion arriv at a total differ concept of the natur of electr resistance. the electrons, we find, are deriv from the environment. it wa brought out in volum i [larson' book \"noth but motion\"] that there are physic process in oper which produc electron in substanti quantities, and that, although the motion that constitut these electron are, in mani cases, absorb by atom structures, the opportun for util thi type of motion in such structur are limited. it follow that there is alway a larg excess of free electron in the materi sector [materi half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged. in thi uncharg state the electron cannot move with respect to extens space, becaus they are inher rotat unit of space, and the relat of space to space is not motion. in open space, therefore, each uncharg electron remain perman in the same locat with respect to the natur refer system, in the manner of a photon. in the context of the stationari spatial refer system the uncharg electron, like the photon, is carri outward at the speed of light by the progress of the natur refer system. all materi aggreg are thu expos to a flux of electron similar to the continu bombard by photon of radiation. meanwhil there are other processes, to be discuss later, wherebi electron are return to the environment. the electron popul of a materi aggreg such as the earth therefor stabil at an equilibrium level.\" note that in larson' theory, uncharg electron are also massless, and are basic photon of light of a particular frequenc (abov the \"unit\" frequency) spin around one axi at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate). (\"unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are vibrat and rotat equival to the speed of light, accord to larson' theory.) [i might have the \"above\" and \"below\" label mix up.] larson is say that outer space is fill with mass- less un-charg electron fli around at the speed of light! if thi is true, then the electro-magnet propuls field of spacecraft might be abl to interact with these electrons, or other particl in space, perhap give them a charg (and mass) and shoot them toward the rear to achiev propulsion. (in larson' theory, an electr charg is a one-dimension rotat vibrat of a particular frequenc (abov the \"unit\" frequency) superimpos on the rotat of the particle.) the paragraph quot abov might also give a clue to confus meteorologist about how and whi lightn is gener in clouds. suppress of larsonian physic the comprehens gener unifi theori of the physic univers develop by the late physicist dewey b. larson ha been avail for more than 30 years, publish in 1959 in hi first book \"the structur of the physic universe\". it is total un-scientif for hawking, wheeler, sagan, and the other sacr priest of the religion they call \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as the \"scientific\" literatur and the \"education\" systems, to total ignor larson' theori ha they have. larson' theori ha excel explan for mani thing now puzzl orthodox physicist and astronomers, such as gamma-ray burst and the natur of quasars. larson' theori deserv to be honestli and openli discuss in the physics, chemistry, and astronomi journals, in the u.s. and elsewhere. and at least the basic principl of larson' theori should be includ in all relat cours at uw-ec, uw-madison, cambridge, cornel university, and elsewhere, so that student are not kept in the dark about a worthi altern to the dogma they are be fed. for more information, answer to your questions, etc., pleas consult my cite sourc (especi larson' books). un-alt reproduct and dissemin of thi import partial summari is encouraged. robert e. mcelwain b.s., physic and astronomy, uw-ec newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84450 from: lwb@cs.utexas.edu (lanc w. bledsoe) subject: re: on-lin copi of book of mormon in articl <1993apr23.163823.24226@ads.com> wmoore@ads.com (william moore) writes: >can anyon provid me a ftp site where i can obtain a onlin version >of the book of mormon. pleas email the internet address if possible. i have a copy. whi are you interested?

element of truth, but jesu explain it far better and gave reasons. thoma paine, benjamin franklin, thoma jefferson are mere men. they can screw up the bibl just as well as ani man. i do not put these men on a pedestal. and if i rememb t.j.' autobiographi correctly, he thought thoma pain wa the most unread man he ever met. here' some more circular reason to you. paul say to the corinthian that \"that the gospel will be foolish to the world, becaus it is spiritu discerned.\" and so, peopl without the spirit of god haven't a clue to what the bibl is saying. from your point of view, that' incred circular and convenient. to me, it is mysteri and supernatur bizarre. i can see it, but you can't. thi is not arrog on my part. trust me. it is as bizarr to you as it is to me. but nonetheless, it is a truth, explain or not. are ani of you color blind to red and green? i am. rememb those dot test they do at the optomologist's? they put pictur in front of you and you are suppos to identifi the pattern in the dots? if your eye are perfectli normal, you can see letter or numer embed in the dots. they are a slightli differ color and stand out from the background. but if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anyth but gray-shad dots. that is how a dot test appear to me. i do not see a pattern at all. a normal see person will see the patterns. and to him, i seem like a total anomaly. to him, i appear as if i am miss the univers or something. it is hard for him to understand whi i can't see anyth that to him is as plain as day. that it what it is like with the bible, the word of god, to the believer. the believ can see the mean in the words. i can see how the pattern fit together. there is such depth. such consistency. but then, on the other hand, i notic the non-believer. he doesn't see it. he think i am weird becaus he think i am see things. i look at him, and say, \"no, you are weird. you do not see.\" then it is time for a saniti check. i go to anoth christian and say, \"do you see this.\" and they go, \"yes. it is an \"x\"\". and i say, \"thank god, i see the \"x\" too.\" it is truli the strangest thing. it add a littl extra dimens to the phrase, \"he will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.\" i am glad that jesu ha enabl me to see. i wish everi non-believ could see what they are missing. newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84511 from: tbrent@bank.ecn.purdue.edu (timothi j brent) subject: re: a messag for you mr. president: how do you know what happened?

(in the bibl it ha noth to do with fire!) most modern bibic translat admit that the use in the english word hell to translat hade and sheol are an unfortun and mislead practice. why? becaus when see the word \"hell\" mani reader imput to it the tradit connot of an ever-burn inferno, when thi wa never remot intend in the greek languag or in old english! in it true bibic usag hade doe inde refer to the state or abod of the dead, but not in the sens of spirit walk around in some sort of \"shadowi realm.\" hade is simpli the abod we call the grave. all dead go to thi hell. the second \"hell\" of the bible, tartaros, is mention onli onc in scripture, 2 pet.2:4; \"for if god spare not the angel that sinned, but cast them down to hell (tartaros), and deliv them into chain of dark to be reserv unto judgment...\" follow their rebellion to unseat god from hi throne (isa.14:12-14; rev.12:4), the archangel lucif (now satan) and a third of the creat angel (now demons) were eject from heaven (luke 10:18). they were cast down to tartaros, a place or condit of restraint that god ha impos on the mutin angel as they await ultim judgment (jude 6; 1 cor.6:3). tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that appli onli to evil, rebelli angel or demon (it is interest that the ancient greek use thi word to describ the place in which zeu confin the rebelli titans). nowher in the bibl is there ani mention of men be put into thi particular \"hell\". the the third word that is translat as \"hell\" in the bibl is gehenna. it come from the hebrew gai hinnom, mean \"valley of hinniom.\" hinnom is a deep, narrow ravin locat to the south and southwest of jerusalem. in old testament time it wa a place of abomin pagan rites, includ infant sacrific (it wa there that the apost king ahaz and manasseh made their children \"pass through the fire\" to the god molech. the rite were specif celebr in tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief grove in the valley). king josiah of ancient judah final put an end to these abominations. he defil the valley, render it ceremoni unclean (2 king 23:10). later the valley becam the cesspool and citi dump of jerusalem; a repositori for sewage, refus and anim carcasses. the bodi of dispis crimin were also burn there along with the rubbish. fire burn continuously, feed by a constant suppli of garbag and refuse. aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchas with the money juda receiv for the betray of christ (matt.27:8) wa also in part of the valley of hinnom. so what doe thi valley call gehenna have to do with hell? in rev.19:20: the satan inspir polit dictat and a miracle-work religi figure, the fals prophet, work with him will resist the re-establish of the govern of god by jesu christ at hi second coming. their fate is reveal by the apostl john: \"and the beast wa taken, and with him the fals prophet... these both were cast aliv into a lake of fire burn with brimstone.\" where will thi temporari lake of fire (thi \"hell\") be? the prophet isaiah wrote of thi lake of fire prepar for the beast: \"for tophet (in the valley of hinnom) is ordain of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindl it\" (isa.30:33). one thousand year later, satan himself will be cast into thi rekindl fieri lake where the beast and fals prophet were cast! (rev.20:10). but what of the wick who have die over the millennia? doe the bibl say that they are now suffer fieri punish for their sin in a lake of fire? in the sequenc of rev.20 the incorrig wick are resurrect to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there! (rev.20:15). what will becom of these wicked? will they writh in flame for eternity? the wick will be burn up from the intens heat of the come gehenna fire on the earth. they wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed! thi punish will be everlast (perman and final). the bibl call it the \"second death\" (rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibl of a further resurrection. the bibl doe teach etern punishment, but not etern punishing. the prophet malachi provid a graphic description. \"for, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\" (4:1). to the righteous, god say that the wick shall be \"ash under the sole of your feet...\"(mal.4:3). gehenna wa a place of destruct and death, not a place of live torture! jesu wa talk to jew who understood all about thi gehenna or valley of hinnom. utter destruct by fire wa complete. noth wa left, but ashes! everi text in the bibl translat from thi greek word gehenna mean complet destruction, not live tortur (not etern life in torment)! the bibl says, in roman 6:23, \"the wage of sin is death\", not etern life in torture. the punish reveal in the bibl is death... the cessat of life. etern life is the gift of god! newsgroup: talk.religion.misc document_id: 84562 from: sbuckley@fraser.sfu.ca (stephen buckley) subject: re: cult (who keep them go ?) muttiah@thistle.ecn.purdue.edu (ranjan s muttiah) writes: >in articl <sbuckley.735337212@sfu.ca> sbuckley@fraser.sfu.ca (stephen buckley) writes: >>>... bad thought these. >> >> well it depend on whether you take the liter dictionari definit of >>cult and say all faith are cults, or if you take a more social-context >>view of \"cult which allow you to recogn mainstream religion as >>socially-accept and cult as group that involv techniqu of brain- >>wash and all the other characterist that defin oppress [probli not >>the *best* word] cult behaviour. >yeah, but implicitli the social-context view provid a justif >for the dictionari definit of a cult; those who follow the mainstream >pretend while those in cult act base on the veri same impulses. now >who is to be taken serious ?
